## What Is Tiktok Reaction Video

Reaction videos are exactly what they sound like — a video of someone reacting to something. Reaction videos have been around since the early days of YouTube when people would upload their reactions to music, movies, and TV shows. But with the launch of TikTok in 2017, reaction videos exploded in popularity. They are one of the most popular video types on social media platforms.

Reaction videos are a type of video where people record their reactions to other content as it unfolds before them. Reaction videos are popular on TikTok because they elicit an emotional response from the viewer. The most common emotions are joy, sadness, surprise, disgust, fear, and anger.
