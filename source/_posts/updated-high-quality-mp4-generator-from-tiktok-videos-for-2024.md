## Part 3: How to Find Trends on TikTok?

Here are the three ways to find the latest trends on this platform.

### Go Over the Discover Page

It is the best place to start looking for the trending hashtags, sounds, and challenges. You will find the latest hashtags and trends under the trends section.

### Spot Up-and-Coming Trends

The TikTok algorithm doesn’t curate trends and thus, whatever you find on the For Your Page is a mix of trending videos. But remember, the trends don’t last for more than 5-7 days.

### Follow Trending Creators

One of the best ways to find new trends is to follow all trending creators who jump on the latest trends.

### Conclusion

New TikTok trends are being introduced every day. So, make sure you keep a check. To create your TikTok videos, you can use the Filmora editing tool and make use of its features.
