### ● Shabu Shabu

### ● Kaiseki

### ● Jollof rice

It can be served as a side dish or as a meal with additional ingredients. Some users have added sausages and fried plantains to their jollof rice before serving.

### ● Suya

It’s another popular African food called TikTok. Suya is a snack that can be found all over Nigeria and West Africa. It consists of skewers of meat covered in peanut butter and spices like ginger powder, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, salt, vegetable oil, and bouillon cubes. The meat can be made from any cut of beef or chicken but traditionally uses beef steak or chicken thigh filet.

### ● Fufu

Fufu is a soft white dough made from cassava or yams flour (also known as cassava flour). It may also be made from plantain or cocoyam. Fufu is normally eaten with stews and soups like Peanut Soup in Ghana, Egusi Soup in Nigeria, etc.
