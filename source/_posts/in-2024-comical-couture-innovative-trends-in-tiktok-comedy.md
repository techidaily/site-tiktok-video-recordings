### Prerequisites of Going Live on TikTok

Before learning how to invite others on TikTok, let's shed light on the requirements of going live on this social app. The reason is that not everyone can go for live streaming on TikTok, as there are certain restrictions you need to keep in your mind.

* To start live streaming on your TikTok, you should have at least 1000 followers.
* You should be 16 years old or above to access the live stream feature.
* To use virtual gifts during a live stream on TikTok, you should be 18 years old or above.
