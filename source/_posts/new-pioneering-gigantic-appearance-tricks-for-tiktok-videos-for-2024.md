As the name suggests, you just have to use a projector to display all kinds of images on a wall or a curtain (making it look like a window). Go ahead and unleash your creative ideas for some stunning video projections and post them on TikTok.

#### 3\. Questions I Get Asked… Trend

#### 4\. Outfit Challenge
