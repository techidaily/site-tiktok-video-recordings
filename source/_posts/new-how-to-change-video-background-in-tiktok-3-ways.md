### ● Sushi

Sushi is perhaps the most popular Japanese dish outside of Japan. It consists of cooked vinegared rice combined with other ingredients, seafood, vegetables, and sometimes tropical fruits. It’s mostly served with pickled ginger, wasabi, and soy sauce.

Sushi comes in many types, which include nigiri-zushi (oval-shaped rice topped with a slice of raw fish or seafood). Gunkan-maki is another type of sushi that is seaweed filled with rice and fish roe or other ingredients such as sea urchin roe or oysters.

### ● Hiyashi Chuka

Hiyashi chuka is a cold version of ramen, served with a mix of thinly sliced cucumbers, tomatoes, ham, and eggs. It's normally served during the summer months only.

### ● Shabu Shabu

Shabu shabu is a hot pot dish in which very thinly sliced beef and vegetables are cooked in water or broth and eaten with a dipping sauce. At the table, diners dip their meat and vegetables into the broth to cook them before eating.

### ● Kaiseki

Kaiseki meal is a multi-course meal that combines traditional Japanese aesthetics with seasonal ingredients. The dishes are usually smaller and more intricate than other dishes, making kaiseki one of the most beautiful cuisines in the world.

### ● Yakitori

Yakitori refers to chicken grilled on a skewer and seasoned with salt or tare sauce (a mix of soy sauce, sake, mirin, and sugar). They can be made from all different parts of the chicken, including breast, thigh, skin and cartilage among other things.

## TikTok African Food

African cuisine is a delight, and TikTok is making it more popular. African food is slowly becoming a trend on TikTok.

The continent of Africa is so big that it's hard to generalize about its cuisine, or even to group its cuisines into categories. Even within individual countries or regions, you will find an astonishing variety of foods and flavors.

But there are some common themes that run through most African cuisines:

A preference for starchy staples – such as rice, yams, millet, sorghum, and maize (corn) – paired with sauces made from local ingredients such as tomatoes, leafy greens, peppers, and beans.

### ● Jollof rice

Nigerian jollof rice is one of the country's most popular dishes, and it's become a staple on TikTok. Jollof rice is a rice dish made with tomatoes, green peppers, onion, and spices like ginger, garlic, paprika, and black pepper.

It can be served as a side dish or as a meal with additional ingredients. Some users have added sausages and fried plantains to their jollof rice before serving.

### ● Suya

It’s another popular African food called TikTok. Suya is a snack that can be found all over Nigeria and West Africa. It consists of skewers of meat covered in peanut butter and spices like ginger powder, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, salt, vegetable oil, and bouillon cubes. The meat can be made from any cut of beef or chicken but traditionally uses beef steak or chicken thigh filet.

### ● Fufu

Fufu is a soft white dough made from cassava or yams flour (also known as cassava flour). It may also be made from plantain or cocoyam. Fufu is normally eaten with stews and soups like Peanut Soup in Ghana, Egusi Soup in Nigeria, etc.

### ● Braai

Braai comes from South Africa's BBQ tradition and is an important part of social gatherings in South Africa. There are several kinds of meat cooked on a grill such as steak, chicken, pork chops, sausages, etc.

## Conclusion

After a long, hard day of work, you simply can’t imagine what to eat. Doesn’t matter if you are exhausted, stressed out, or even in a bad mood; food is the magic elixir that can make your day or spoil it completely.

Eating a tasty meal is one way to relieve stress and refresh yourself. If you need some inspiration for your next cuisine from another country, you will find this collection of popular foods on TikTok very helpful.
