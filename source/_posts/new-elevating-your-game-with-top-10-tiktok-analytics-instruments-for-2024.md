## Section 1. Mac or Desktop Video Editors vs. Mobile Video Editors for TikTok

There are several video editors that TikTokers use to attract millions of viewers such as TikTok’s built-in video editor, mobile app editors, and online editors for Mac. However, editing on mobile phones or using built-in editors have their own limitations, therefore editing TikTok videos on desktop or Mac is way better.

Let’s go through a few benefits that [Mac video editing software](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) can provide to your TikTok videos.

* Enjoy richer fonts, filters, stickers, and transitional effects than mobile apps
* Many advanced functions, such as auto-reframe, motion track, and AI Portrait
* Sharing with partners becomes easy when working on Mac or a desktop

## Section 2. TikTok Video Editors That Can Make Stunning Videos on Mac
