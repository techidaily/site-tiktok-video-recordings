### Method 3: Use Mask and Scale to Make a Video with Big Head Effect

Besides adding magnify effects and bubblehead effects, you can also use the mask preset to create a big head effect in Filmora.

Drag and drop the video to video track 1 and video track 2 respectively in Filmora. Then go to the **Effect** tab, and scroll down to the **Utility** category, and place the Image Mask effect to the video above. Or, you can type _image mask_ in the search bar to locate it quickly.

Now, double-click the video with the image mask to adjust the properties. Scroll down to the Video Effects field, and you will see the Image Mask. Click the arrow icon to choose a mask preset, adjust its position and size settings to fit the video.

Tips: You can hide the video in track 1 by clicking the eye icon so you can adjust the video with the image mask conveniently. Click it again then you will see the video.

Next, click the video in track 2 again, and then go to the **Transform** tab, use the **Scale** slider to adjust the video size to make a big head effect.
