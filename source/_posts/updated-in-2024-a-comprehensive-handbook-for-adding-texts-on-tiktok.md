This article has shed light on various ways how to add captions on TikTok efficiently. You can add TikTok captions manually or use the auto-generator for ease. Moreover, we have also highlighted an online tool to create subtitles that can be accessed from any web browser. However, if you want a professional caption editor for a longer run, Wondershare Filmora is the best choice among other tools. It has an easy-to-use interface and achieves accurate results comfortably.
