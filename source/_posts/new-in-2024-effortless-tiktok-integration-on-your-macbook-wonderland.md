## Tips to Create Trending Videos on TikTok

To make sure that your videos on TikTok are trending, you can take the help of a few tips listed below.

![tiktok web](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/tiktok-web.jpg)

### 1. Post a Video At Least Once Every Day

The platform expects its successful creators to post videos often. In case you wish to go viral, you need to create enough content for people to notice you. If you would like to create a low-profile, your profile might not appear often in the user’s feed.

The top accounts release videos several times every day. However, this level of production might be difficult for one person without compromising on the video’s quality. So, upload at least one video every day.

### 2. Make Sure the Videos are of High-Quality

The importance of this cannot be emphasized enough. TikTok is all about trending videos. Hence, you have to make sure that you are sharing footage of top-notch quality. Yes, you might have to upload videos daily, but that doesn’t mean you should sacrifice quality for quantity. For this, however, you don’t have to employ a professional camera operator. You can create videos using your smartphone and then edit them using good software. This ensures that you make videos that will go viral. You can use an external microphone if the sound is an essential component.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3. Do Not Ignore Sounds

One of the primary differences of TikTok has been the liberty that it gives you to use music in the videos that people are sharing. It is incredibly easy to add music to your 15-seconds video on this platform. TikTok has made arrangements with the top music companies to get permission to use the copyrighted music extracts.

You will be able to add music tracks to your videos without any hassle from the app itself.

### 5. Showcase Your Skills in the Video

In case you are looking for content ideas for the videos, you should ask yourself the skill you have. Several Tiktokers create videos of them doing something that they are good at. This can be playing an instrument, skateboarding, or playing a sport like fire-eating or juggling. There are many dancers that showcase their skills in lip-sync videos. Hence, you need to recognize your skill and use it to make your videos.

### 1. Post a Video At Least Once Every Day

The platform expects its successful creators to post videos often. In case you wish to go viral, you need to create enough content for people to notice you. If you would like to create a low-profile, your profile might not appear often in the user’s feed.

The top accounts release videos several times every day. However, this level of production might be difficult for one person without compromising on the video’s quality. So, upload at least one video every day.

### 2. Make Sure the Videos are of High-Quality

The importance of this cannot be emphasized enough. TikTok is all about trending videos. Hence, you have to make sure that you are sharing footage of top-notch quality. Yes, you might have to upload videos daily, but that doesn’t mean you should sacrifice quality for quantity. For this, however, you don’t have to employ a professional camera operator. You can create videos using your smartphone and then edit them using good software. This ensures that you make videos that will go viral. You can use an external microphone if the sound is an essential component.
