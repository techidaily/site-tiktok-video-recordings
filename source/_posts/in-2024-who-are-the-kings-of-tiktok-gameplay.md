## Part 1: What is PFP on TikTok?

PFP corresponds to Profile Picture on TikTok. Unlike other social media platforms, TikTok users use PFPs to denote profile pictures. On the contrary, only PP is used for the profile picture on other mainstream social media sites. Moreover, PFP is used for Picture For Proof on social media sites, except TikTok. So, PFP is asked as proof to show your current activity. In addition, it may also be requested as your identity proof. However, when you see PFP on TikTok, your only concern should be your profile picture.

## Part 2: What is the PFP hashtag on TikTok?

Hashtags are used to emphasize a specific topic that is in the spotlight. Moreover, hashtags may also manifest trends on different social media platforms like Twitter, Facebook, etc. On TikTok, hashtags are added to help TikTok users navigate your content. So, if you have tagged your content with a specific hashtag, your post is likely to appear in the content list for someone searching for a relevant hashtag. However, the PFP hashtag is used for different purposes on TikTok. It helps you get maximum likes. Plus, it may also increase your followership by engaging your audience in funny profile pictures. So, the PFP hashtag must be checked to find crazy profile pictures and videos.
