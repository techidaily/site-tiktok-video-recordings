### 10\. Learn on TikTok

TikTok is a great platform for creators to share their skills and ideas. This is the trend that includes all types of learning, from specific skills to life lessons. You might think that these short-form videos might not be good for learning but you will be proved wrong.

### 11\. Damn, What Is That Bro?

If there is something you would pay for, use this trend to tell your audience. It can be a great option for businesses.

### 12\. I’m Bad Michael Jackson Trend

It is one of the TikTok music trends on the song Bad by Michael Jackson and the users do the classic toe stand by the star. Do they stand and freeze the frame in the final pose?

### 13\. Shapeshift Filter Look-Alike Trend

It is a shapeshift filter and tells you which celebrity you look like. But it is a tricky trend and you can choose the celebrity you want to look like.

### 14\. GTA San Andreas Loading Screen

No matter if you are a gaming buff or not, you will love the trend where your image changes to the GTA San Andreas loading poster.

### 15\. In This House -Marcus Vinicius

The trend has 8-10 images and a video clip and these are cut to beat the song, In This House.

## Part 3: How to Find Trends on TikTok?

Here are the three ways to find the latest trends on this platform.

### Go Over the Discover Page

It is the best place to start looking for the trending hashtags, sounds, and challenges. You will find the latest hashtags and trends under the trends section.

### Spot Up-and-Coming Trends

The TikTok algorithm doesn’t curate trends and thus, whatever you find on the For Your Page is a mix of trending videos. But remember, the trends don’t last for more than 5-7 days.

### Follow Trending Creators

One of the best ways to find new trends is to follow all trending creators who jump on the latest trends.

### Conclusion

New TikTok trends are being introduced every day. So, make sure you keep a check. To create your TikTok videos, you can use the Filmora editing tool and make use of its features.
