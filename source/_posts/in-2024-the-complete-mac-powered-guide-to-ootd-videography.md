## Make a TikTok video Easily using Filmora

If you look at the built-in video editor of the TikTok app, you will notice that the interface is not user-friendly at all. But this does not mean there is no way to make a TikTok music video. Filmora is an advanced video editor for both Mac and PC that has many features that make it a great choice for TikTok videos. We'll walk you through the process:

**Step 1:** First of all, make sure that the latest version of Filmora Video editor is downloaded on your computer. If you haven't already installed it, you can easily download it from the official website of Wondershare.

**Step 2:** Now, Install the application and run it on your computer.

**Step 3:** A window will appear on your screen where you need to select the new project option.

**Step 4:** In the next step, you need to select the aspect ratio. Keep in mind that by default, the aspect ratio will be 16:9, which is landscape, but since the TikTok videos are in portrait orientation, we need to select 9:16 and click ok.

**Step 5:** Now, you can import the media files to your Filmora library. Just click on the file, select import media, and click on the Import media files. Now select the video files that you want to edit, and they will be imported to your Filmora Library.

**Step 6:** Now, drag the videos from the Library and drop them to your timeline. Once you have the videos in your timeline, you can perform all the edits that you want to perform.
