## Section 1. Make an Intro Video on TikTok (iPhone)

In case you are all set to create a Tiktok intro video, here are a few tips you need to follow.

• Including Audio

At the top of the screen, you will find the option ‘Sound’. This is where you can look through the music. When you are done choosing the song, decide where you would like it to start and play it when you record to sync the shots better. You can also add sound effects and voice-over.

At present, you can add one song per video inside the app. However, you always have the option to edit the videos using other apps to upload on TikTok.

In TikTok, you can work with multiple audio layers. For example, you have recorded the clip with in-camera audio, sound effect, music, and anything else you have added. The app will let you lower the camera’s audio volume while raising the music volume.

• Working with the Text

For adding title or text to the video, you have to use the Text button. This lets you choose the color, font, and size of the words. If you have used Instagram fonts, this will appear similar. Once you enter the words, choose where you would like to apply them on the screen. You can also set the time and length of the text appearing on the screen.

• Adding Effects

Effects are one of the special aspects of TikTok. There are two ways to use them, before or after recording. When you’re done recording the video, you can reverse it, speed it up, or add filters. The app also lets you apply an effect when you are recording.

Since TikTok videos are mostly viewed on smartphones, vertical orientation is the best option. However, horizontal orientation is also allowed on TikTok. **The best aspect ratio will be 9:16 for TikTok videos** so that they can be viewed properly on any smartphone. Last, but not least, **the dimension has to be 1080 x 1920.**
