Both iPhone and Android users can install the TikTok app on their devices, and the process of downloading videos with this app to the camera roll is identical for iOS and Android operating systems.

All you have to do is launch the TikTok app from your phone and tap on the **Account icon** that is located in the bottom right corner of the app's main window.

All the videos you posted to TikTok are located on your profile page, so you simply have to select the video you want to download and tap on it.

The video will automatically start playing and you can just tap on the **Share icon** in the lower right section of the screen and proceed to select the **Download option** from the new window that contains different share options.

The download will start immediately after you tap on the **Download icon**, and the video will be saved to your phone's camera roll.

## Method 2: Using the Video Downloader Apps to Download other TikTok Videos

The process of downloading videos to a Smartphone directly from the TikTok app can be quite slow, so if you want to save videos from this video sharing platform to your phone in no time you can try using some of the downloader apps for Musical.ly that are available at the Google Play store.

### Downloading TikTok Videos With the Video Downloader for Musical.ly

Once you've installed the [Video Downloader for Musical.ly](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.avalon.musically.downloader) on your phone, you should open the TikTok app and locate the video you want to save.

Launch the Video Downloader for Musical.ly app and paste the link to the designated destination in the app. The preview of your video will appear on the screen, and you'll be able to choose between **Save Image** and **Download Video** options.

Tap on the **Download Video** option and wait for the download process to be completed. You won't have to wait long, as the app downloads videos faster than the TikTok app.

### Downloading Videos From TikTok Using the Downloader for Musical.ly app

You can also send TikTok videos to yourself by inserting your own email address into both sections.

Go to your email account where you will be able to see the video you sent to yourself or to your friend. The **Download option** will be displayed next to the video, so just click on it in order to save the video to your phone.

## Method 4: Saving MP4 Video Files to a PC
