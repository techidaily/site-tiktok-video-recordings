**Step** **4:** Then, go to the next step after selecting the desired speed. As seen below, you must record the video by **Tapping and Holding the Red Color Record button** for some time.

**Note**: Once the video has been recorded and is in a slower speed, it will automatically be recorded in slow motion. You can use this method to record your TikTok videos with a slow-motion effect.

## Part 2: How o Add Slow-Mo Effects After Recording Videos on Tik Tok?

What about the videos you have already recorded on your TikTok application? Can you slow them down too? The following steps illustrate how to apply a slow-motion effect to your TikTok videos once they have been recorded using the app.

It is simple to record a video by simply going to the "Add new" area and selecting the video of your choosing to record. When you've finished recording, choose the next choice from the drop-down menu. Following that, you may proceed with the procedure.

**Step 1**: Once you've arrived at the next screen, you'll need to click on the **Circular clock** symbol to activate the effect. It is located in the bottom left corner of the screen, as seen below.

**Tip:** To access it, click on it. To access the effects, tap on it once. The effects under the **Filter** effects section will be immediately activated.

![tiktok special effects option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-special-effects-option.jpg)

Step 2: To use this feature, you must browse the Time Effects part of the effects section. To do so, choose "**Time effects**" from the drop-down menu in the bottom right corner of the screen, as shown by the arrow in the image below. It will provide you with different temporal effects.

![tiktok time effects option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-time-effects-option.jpg)

**Step 3:** It is necessary to choose the **Slow Motion** option from the list of alternatives that appears, as shown in the figure below. This will give the video the appearance of being in slow motion.

**Tip**: Changing the length of the slow-motion is accomplished by dragging the green square that appears on the screen. **Drag it** to any portion of the page where you want the slow-motion effect to appear.

![tiktok slow motion effect](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-slow-motion-effect.jpg)

**Step 4:** Once you're pleased with the effect, you may save it by selecting the save option from the menu. As seen in the illustration below, click on "**Save**" will save your work.

**(Note**: You will be returned to the previous screen if you do so. After that, you may edit it with whatever filters you want and publish it just like any other video).

## Part 3: How to Slow Down Tik Tok Videos Online for Free?

### Kapwing

In a couple of seconds, Kapwing can speed up and slow down short videos. Slo-mo, timelapse, and hyperspeed films may be made with no editing skills then shared on social networking websites like YouTube.

Get started by uploading a video or pasting a URL. AVI, MP4, MOV, and 3PG are all supported formats by Kapwing. As slow as 0.25x for a slow-motion movie and as much as 4x for an enhanced video are available. Let's give you a step-by-step illustration:

**Step 1:** On TikTok, find the video you want to slow down and click on. You have the option of slowing down videos from other people's profiles and those from your profile. **Copy the URL** that appears when you click the **Share** button.

**Step 2:** This is where Kapwing comes in, and we utilize it on our PC using Chrome to accomplish our objective. Visit <https://www.kapwing.com/> and copy the URL of the TikTok video and paste it into Kapwing.

**Step 3:** Go to the Speed section, and use the – and + buttons to make the video slow down or speed up. After selecting "**slow-motion**" as your preferred speed, press the "**play**" button to begin watching the movie. If the video moves too slowly, click on the **Plus** sign and keep rewatching it until you're satisfied with the pace.

![add slow motion effect kapwing online](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-slow-motion-effect-kapwing-online.jpg)

**Step 4**: This step is optional, but it comes in useful if you're performing in a duet or if you want to watch a TikTok video while you're not connected to the internet. Following your completion of the speed adjustment, go to the top of the studio and click **Export** **Video**. After your video has been processed, you may save it to your device by clicking the **Download** button.
