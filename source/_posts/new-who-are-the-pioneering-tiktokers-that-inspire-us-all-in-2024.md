Before being declared an influencer on TikTok, you must have many views, followers, and likes. But how exactly can you do that? Well, don't miss some essential points to become the mostfamous TikToker mentioned below.

### 1. Take a video with a trending song or audio

First, you have to know what's trending on the internet. It might not work out for you if you rarely spend time on what is happening worldwide. It is because the backbone of TikTok videos is all about trending issues. Also, you don't have to worry about your voice getting noticed. The app comes with many sounds that you can record to conceal your voice. For example, "The Whoa" track produced by Adam Rose went viral, and more than 36,000 people got an idea from that.

### 2. Take advantage of the most common hashtags

Sometimes you will come across a hashtag which is not even related to what you want to post. Just use it even if it has nothing to do with what you want your audience to know. After all, you want your video to feature on the trending list. For instance, a dance by Marilyn Monroe had many hashtags like #keepingitbusy, #shareyourplaylist, and others that were not even related to the contents of the video.

Funny enough, the video went viral and gained over 200 followers. Therefore, please take advantage of the trending hashtags and include them in your video. But don't forget to include some that depict your post's content to avoid making it too irrelevant.

### 3. Maintain your theme

Although your viewers want to get entertained, they will only focus on what they like. It means that you will consistently receive followers when you keep posting about specific themes over time. For example, post content related to cooking and such stuff if you like recipes. Don't keep on mixing themes.

### 4. Don't ever settle on the quality of the video

Before being declared an influencer on TikTok, you must have many views, followers, and likes. But how exactly can you do that? Well, don't miss some essential points to become the mostfamous TikToker mentioned below.

### 1. Take a video with a trending song or audio

First, you have to know what's trending on the internet. It might not work out for you if you rarely spend time on what is happening worldwide. It is because the backbone of TikTok videos is all about trending issues. Also, you don't have to worry about your voice getting noticed. The app comes with many sounds that you can record to conceal your voice. For example, "The Whoa" track produced by Adam Rose went viral, and more than 36,000 people got an idea from that.

Sometimes you will come across a hashtag which is not even related to what you want to post. Just use it even if it has nothing to do with what you want your audience to know.

For instance, a dance by Marilyn Monroe had many hashtags like #keepingitbusy, #shareyourplaylist, and others that were not even related to the contents of the video.

Funny enough, the video went viral and gained over 200 followers. Therefore, please take advantage of the trending hashtags and include them in your video. But don't forget to include some that depict your post's content to avoid making it too irrelevant.

### 3. Maintain your theme

Although your viewers want to get entertained, they will only focus on what they like. It means that you will consistently receive followers when you keep posting about specific themes over time. For example, post content related to cooking and such stuff if you like recipes. Don't keep on mixing themes.

## What Is Tiktok Reaction Video

Reaction videos are exactly what they sound like — a video of someone reacting to something. Reaction videos have been around since the early days of YouTube when people would upload their reactions to music, movies, and TV shows. But with the launch of TikTok in 2017, reaction videos exploded in popularity. They are one of the most popular video types on social media platforms.

Reaction videos are a type of video where people record their reactions to other content as it unfolds before them. Reaction videos are popular on TikTok because they elicit an emotional response from the viewer. The most common emotions are joy, sadness, surprise, disgust, fear, and anger. It's easy to see why these videos are so popular — they're fun!

## Why Are TikTok Videos So Popular?

The popularity of TikTok reaction videos is easy to understand. It is fun to watch people react to something they're seeing for the very first time. In addition, these types of videos are entertaining and silly. They are typically not too serious or dramatic in tone.

Reaction videos allow you to laugh at yourself or laugh with someone else who has been through something similar (or even worse). If someone else has gone through it before, the chances are that they've learned from their mistakes too! This could be an important lesson for you as well!

Reaction videos can give you perspective on your own life. You might realize that things aren't as bad as they seem when seen through someone else's eyes.

Reaction videos are popular on TikTok because they elicit an emotional response from the viewer. The most common emotions are joy, sadness, surprise, disgust, fear, and anger.

## Make a TikTok video Easily using Filmora

If you look at the built-in video editor of the TikTok app, you will notice that the interface is not user-friendly at all. But this does not mean there is no way to make a TikTok music video. Filmora is an advanced video editor for both Mac and PC that has many features that make it a great choice for TikTok videos. We'll walk you through the process:

**Step 1:** First of all, make sure that the latest version of Filmora Video editor is downloaded on your computer. If you haven't already installed it, you can easily download it from the official website of Wondershare.

**Step 2:** Now, Install the application and run it on your computer.

**Step 3:** A window will appear on your screen where you need to select the new project option.

**Step 4:** In the next step, you need to select the aspect ratio. Keep in mind that by default, the aspect ratio will be 16:9, which is landscape, but since the TikTok videos are in portrait orientation, we need to select 9:16 and click ok.

**Step 5:** Now, you can import the media files to your Filmora library. Just click on the file, select import media, and click on the Import media files. Now select the video files that you want to edit, and they will be imported to your Filmora Library.

**Step 6:** Now, drag the videos from the Library and drop them to your timeline. Once you have the videos in your timeline, you can perform all the edits that you want to perform.

**Step 7:** If you want to add effects to your videos, then you can explore the effects section of Filmora, where you can find hundreds of cool effects to make your videos more interesting. If you like any effect and want to apply it to your video, drag the effect and drop it on the video track in the Filmora timeline.

**Step 9:** If you are making a TikTok reaction video using Filmora, then you can easily play two videos side-by-side. You need to place two different videos in two different tracks in Filmora. Then select the first video and adjust the size of the video so that it covers the half area in the preview window. Then repeat the septs to cover the other half of the preview window. By doing this, you can easily make a reaction video in just a few minutes.
