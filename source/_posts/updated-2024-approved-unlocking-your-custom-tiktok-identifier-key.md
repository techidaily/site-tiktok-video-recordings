## Part 1: Why Do TikTok Trends Matter for Creators?

You might be thinking why creators should know about the trends if they can make the video they like? Well, TikTok isn’t just the fastest growing social media channel across the world, with over a billion users, but it also reflects real-life human experience in a comedic and fun manner.

The other social media platforms reflect popular culture but TikTok is driving it, from fashion to songs that are becoming global hits. The platform also has a significant influence on other social media handles.

Even some years ago, just young teens and teens were aware of TikTok. However, things changed in 2021\. There are many videos of parents and elderly people going viral.

TikTok has also become global. It is available in 75 different languages. It is available in more than 155 countries. According to the official statistics of TikTok, 90% of the users access the platform on a daily basis.

Many people ask if trends are good for branding. Sure, it does play a significant role in connecting you to the audience but you still need to understand the culture that you will be serving. If you don’t, you won’t be able to connect with your audience through your work.

When it comes to TikTok, it is just like your high school days. So, the first step to becoming successful is to find out what is popular and be a part of it. However, there is a little more to it than just that.

On TikTok and any other social media, trending content comes with full marketing potential. By following the trends, you can draw in a large base of a highly engaged audience. Also, algorithms recognize the popular trend content. Thus, when you get involved, you can improve your reach and start growing your account.
