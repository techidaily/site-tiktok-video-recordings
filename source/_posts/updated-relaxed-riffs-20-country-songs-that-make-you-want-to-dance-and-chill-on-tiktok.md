Now, double click on the effect in the timeline and open the Properties of the magnify effect. From the Properties section, you can adjust the size of the bubble using functions such as the Radius, CenterY, CenterX, Alpha, Zoom rate, etc to get a better video with big head effects.

![adjust magnify effect settings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-magnify-effect-settings.jpg)

**Note:** If you're unable to locate the Magnify option in the Effects tab, please download and install the latest version of Filmora, and then type "Magnify" in the search bar, and the system will directly take you to where the option is present.

### Method 3: Use Mask and Scale to Make a Video with Big Head Effect

Besides adding magnify effects and bubblehead effects, you can also use the mask preset to create a big head effect in Filmora.

Drag and drop the video to video track 1 and video track 2 respectively in Filmora. Then go to the **Effect** tab, and scroll down to the **Utility** category, and place the Image Mask effect to the video above. Or, you can type _image mask_ in the search bar to locate it quickly.

![add image mask to tiktok video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-image-mask-to-tiktok-video.jpg)

Now, double-click the video with the image mask to adjust the properties. Scroll down to the Video Effects field, and you will see the Image Mask. Click the arrow icon to choose a mask preset, adjust its position and size settings to fit the video.

Tips: You can hide the video in track 1 by clicking the eye icon so you can adjust the video with the image mask conveniently. Click it again then you will see the video.

Next, click the video in track 2 again, and then go to the **Transform** tab, use the **Scale** slider to adjust the video size to make a big head effect.
