**Step 2**: Drag and drag the video right into the interface to edit it. Alternatively, you can choose "**Add files**" from the drop-down menu by clicking the **"+"** button. Using the media library, drag and drop the video you wish to slow down onto the timeline once added to the project.

After that, you may use various editing tools to create your video one-of-a-kind and spectacular, depending on your requirements.

**Step 5**: It's time to save your modified movie clip to your device. Click the Export button to save the video to your local or share to YouTube or Vimeo directly.
