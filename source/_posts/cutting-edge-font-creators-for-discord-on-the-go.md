Discord is a very popular platform that brings people with similar interests together and allows them to communicate using a range of textual and audiovisual elements. Still, most people use text to chat with others, which is why the fact that only one default font is available is so troublesome.

Using different fonts is a great way to make your messages more visually attractive and impress your friends. To do that, you will have to find a good Discord font generator and use it to create custom messages that include a wide variety of letter shapes.

Since there are so many online tools that can be used for generating fonts, we prepared an overview of the best options at your disposal that will present you with the strengths and weaknesses of each Discord font generator from the list.

## Part 3: Why You Should Use Different Text Font on Discord?

Some people are content with the default text style on Discord and don’t see the need to use font generators, but advanced users enjoy the freedom of expression they gain in this way. Communication on Discord is fast-paced and it can be difficult to gain the attention of the group, which is why it makes sense to use variable and/or unusual fonts for your messages.

Not only you can make more persuasive arguments in this way, but you can also boost your engagement and visibility on the platform. Of course, many people use Discord font generators just for fun, and this is perfectly all right, too. If a few more clicks can make your experience more entertaining and more fulfilling, that’s a tradeoff worth making.

**Conclusion – Which Discord Font Generator to Choose?**

From all of the above, it’s clear that you won’t make a mistake if you try a few of the products from this list. All Discord font generators serve a similar purpose and come with comparable features, so the best way to find the right one is to play around a little bit and see which one feels the most natural to use.
