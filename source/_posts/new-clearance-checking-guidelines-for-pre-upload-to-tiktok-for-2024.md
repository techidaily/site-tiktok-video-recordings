## Clearance-Checking Guidelines for Pre-Upload to TikTok

So, you have successfully created an awesome TikTok video with the perfect dance moves and accurate lip-sync. But what’s this? Your video gets muted or taken down! What a bummer!

The reason?

Copyright infringement, or in simple words, using music without the permission of the singer!

This includes external sounds that are not a part of the TikTok library.

So, what should we do to avoid this, you ask?

To avoid this, you need to learn how to check TikTok video copyright before uploading.

And, in this article, we will tell you exactly why you need to follow TikTok copyright, and how to check it before posting a video.

## **Why Do You Need to Follow Tiktok Copyright?**

To avoid getting banned!

You see, TikTok has a vast library of sounds with proper legal authorization that is available for the users to use in their videos. However, sometimes people use their own music in the videos.

The external sound may or may not be copyrighted.

If it does not have any copyrights on it, all is good. But in case you accidentally use a copyrighted video, TikTok automatically detects it, and either mutes your video or takes it down entirely. If the copyright is detected while posting, the platform will prevent you from uploading it in the first place.

To be on the safe side, we recommend using sounds already present in the TikTok library.

But, what if you want to use an external sound? Is there a way to check TikTok video copyright before uploading?

Yes, there is! And in the next section, we will tell you all about it.

## **Check Tiktok Video Copyright Before Uploading**

Whenever you’re posting a video to TikTok, you get the option of running a copyright check on it. But this option is only available on desktop browsers.

Therefore, if you’re posting a sound other than one from TikTok’s library, you can check if it’s copyrighted or not from your PC.

Here’s how:

**Step 1**

Go to the website version of [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/) from Chrome, and click on “Log In” at the top-right corner of the page. You can also click on “Log In” under the “Following” option on the left.

## **Conclusion**

While making TikTok videos is quite a fun activity, we have to follow the rules, especially those revolving around using copyrighted material. According to TikTok’s policies, if a video has copyrighted sound, it will be muted, and if the video itself is copyrighted, like a clip from a movie or song, it will be taken down.

However, if you continue posting copyrighted content even after receiving copyright infringement notices from TikTok, it can result in your getting shut down for good!

Therefore, it’s good to know how to check TikTok video copyright before uploading through the steps explained in the article.

So, run a copyright check, and play it safe!

## **Check Tiktok Video Copyright Before Uploading**

Whenever you’re posting a video to TikTok, you get the option of running a copyright check on it. But this option is only available on desktop browsers.

Therefore, if you’re posting a sound other than one from TikTok’s library, you can check if it’s copyrighted or not from your PC.

Here’s how:

**Step 1**

Go to the website version of [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/) from Chrome, and click on “Log In” at the top-right corner of the page. You can also click on “Log In” under the “Following” option on the left.

![login to the website version of tiktok ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/1-how-to-check-tiktok-video-copyright-before-uploading.png)

**Step 2**

You will get a popup asking you to either sign up to Tiktok or log in using your email, Facebook, Twitter, Google, Apple, or Instagram. You can choose whichever option you find convenient.

![login to tiktok via email ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/2-how-to-check-tiktok-video-copyright-before-uploading.png)

**Step 3**

Click on the “Upload” option indicated by a cloud with an arrow.

![tap on “upload” option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/3-how-to-check-tiktok-video-copyright-before-uploading.png)

**Step 4**

Click on “Select Video to Upload” and choose a video from your PC’s storage.

![choose the video from pc to upload](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/4-how-to-check-tiktok-video-copyright-before-uploading.png)

**Step 5**

Once the video is uploaded, add a caption with hashtags and select the cover for your video.

![add a caption for video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-how-to-check-tiktok-video-copyright-before-uploading.png)

**Step 6**

The next step is to choose whether your video can be viewed by the public or your friends or whether you want to keep it private from everyone.

![change privacy settings for video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/6-how-to-check-tiktok-video-copyright-before-uploading.png)

**Step 7**

You can also allow or restrict users to comment on your video, make duets, or stitch your video.

![allow or restrict users to comment on video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/7-how-to-check-tiktok-video-copyright-before-uploading.png)

**Step 8**

![Turn the toggle](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/8-how-to-check-tiktok-video-copyright-before-uploading.png)

## **Conclusion**

While making TikTok videos is quite a fun activity, we have to follow the rules, especially those revolving around using copyrighted material. According to TikTok’s policies, if a video has copyrighted sound, it will be muted, and if the video itself is copyrighted, like a clip from a movie or song, it will be taken down.

However, if you continue posting copyrighted content even after receiving copyright infringement notices from TikTok, it can result in your getting shut down for good!

Therefore, it’s good to know how to check TikTok video copyright before uploading through the steps explained in the article.

So, run a copyright check, and play it safe!

## Part 4: How to Create a Stunning Cooking Video?

Here are some tricks to create stunning cooking videos-

* Make sure that you plan ahead. If it is your first time, don’t do it on camera. Practice first before recording.
* It can be tricky to use one camera to record the video from a different camera. Using two cameras will give you a better video.
* You shouldn’t distract the viewers from the cooking video. So, don’t wear something loud or white. Go for solid and bright colors.
* Use Filmora’s cooking video template to make your video stand out.
