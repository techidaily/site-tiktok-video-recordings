TikTok is one of the most famous social media apps currently on social media. It has started to take the world by storm since the day it came out. With more than 1 billion downloads, around 700 million people use this app daily.

There are many things to do on Tiktok, such as imitating dialogues, viral videos, songs or you can even make your original video content. The famous forms of entertainment on this application are TikTok dances.

It started with Lil Nas X's song Old Town Road, which introduced a dance challenge. The song didn’t gain much attention till it produced a dance routine on Tiktok. Since then, every now and then there is a new dance routine challenge on Tiktok which goes viral on almost all social media platforms.

## Special Effects That Can Make Your Tiktok Dance Routine Special

Tik Tok comes with various options of different effects on its own. Whenever you make a video on Tik Tok, you can easily add effects from the app after you are done recording. Nevertheless, there is always a limit to the number of effects offered by the app.

You can however add effects to your content via different applications. One of the best and most amazing video effects you can add to your videos is motion tracking. Motion tracking function allows any sticker or animation to follow your actions.

For that execution, you will need an external video editing app to edit your videos. [Wondershare’s FilmoraX](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is recommended to be the best video editing software used for these purposes.

5.When you have done that, the motion tracking box will appear in the preview. Move and resize it according to the subject that you wish to track. Then, select the “render-effect” option so that Filmora can analyze the video.

8.Next, you will need to place the object where you want it to be concerning the subject in the preview box. Make sure that you drag the edge of it on the timeline to match it with the timeline of your subject.

9.When it has been set up, you will need to double-click the footage you have added the tracking function to and go to the motion tracking menu.

10.The drop-down menu will show all the texts and images or animations available. Select the one you want to see.
