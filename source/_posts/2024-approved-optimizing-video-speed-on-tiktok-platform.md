* **Audio Ducking:** Fade or lower the background audio so that the dialogue you want to focus on stands out. Audio ducking introduces a dramatic effect to your video. Using this feature also ensures a professional outlook. The technique might seem sophisticated but is actually a one-click process.

* **Dark/Light Interface:** It doesn't matter what time of the day (or night) it is. Select the model that suits you.
