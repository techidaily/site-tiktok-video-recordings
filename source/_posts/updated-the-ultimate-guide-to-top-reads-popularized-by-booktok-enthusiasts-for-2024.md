Undoubtedly, TikTok is a trending app nowadays. It does not just let you share your talent and creativity; you can also create a big fandom by having millions of followers. While the app has built-in presets and effects, the good news is that you can edit the videos using great computer software. And directly upload it to your TikTok account from your system.

Yes, you heard that right! You can download TikTok or any other Android application using the emulator BlueStacks. However, at the moment, the TikTok app is only available for smartphones, which means that you can't use it from a computer. However, you can install the BlueStacks emulator that lets you use apps from the Google Play Store on Windows and Mac operating systems.

## How to Install TikTok on a PC Computer?

Before you start recording music videos with TikTok on desktops, you have to install the [BlueStacks](https://www.bluestacks.com/) emulator first.

Once the installer launches, click on the **Install Now** button. After the installation is completed, click on the **Complete** button.

Now the BlueStacks emulator is installed on your PC. Launch it and head over to the **App Center** tab. You will be asked to sign in to your Google account. And if you don't have one, you need to create a Google account for using TikTok or any other Android app from your computer.

You can type TikTok into the **Search Bar** that is located in the upper right corner of the emulator's window in order to find the TikTok app on Google Play. Once the app appears in the search results, click on it and proceed to click on the **Install** button. Click **Accept** in the pop-up window to give the app access to the computer's camera. And then after the TikTok app is installed, click on the **Open** button.

You can use the app to record new videos, add sounds, apply filters and effects or trim each video you recorded with TikTok.

## How to Install TikTok on a Mac Computer?

The process of installing the TikTok app on a Mac computer might be a bit more complicated, because the BlueStacks emulator may cause your computer to crash.

Step 1\. Go to the BlueStacks website and click on the **Download** button to initiate the download process.

Step 2\. Open the folder where the BlueStacks installer is located, find the **installer** **dmg. file**, and then double-click on it.

Step 3\. Once the installer window appears on the screen, double-click on the **BlueStacks icon** to start the installation and then click **Continue**.

If the **System Extension** blocked message from appearing on the screen, choose the **Open Security Preferences** and click on the **Allow** button. The emulator will then be installed on your computer.

In order to install the TikTok app on your Mac, you'll have to create a Google account if you don't have one. Once you sign in with your Google account, you can proceed to install the app on your computer. The steps for installing TikTok on PC and Mac computers are the same, so you just need to find the app in the Google Play Store and click on the **Install** button. You can access the TikTok app from the **My Apps** tab in the BlueStack emulator whenever you want to create a new video.
