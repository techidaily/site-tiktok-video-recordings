## Unlock Desktop Video Potential on TikTok

With the increasing trend of using Tiktok to make viral videos, every other person out there is trying their hand at this video-sharing platform. However, while Tiktok itself has many effects and editing options, there are some limitations. For instance, you cannot use the time-lapse effect on Tiktok, or you cannot make a video exceeding 60 seconds.

It becomes difficult to go all out with your videos with these limitations. Therefore, a third-party or external video editor is necessary to make better and different videos.

In this article, we will go over different ways how to create successful Tiktok videos on Desktop, Android, and iPhone.

Once all the settings have been finalized, click on “Post” to post the video to Tiktok.

![tap on “post” option to upload the video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/25-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)

## **Conclusion**

Tiktok videos are not only about following the trends; in fact, you can use them to create brand awareness, market your product or services, or engage with your audience in an effective way. However, the key is to make a video worth watching! And while Tiktok’s built-in editor has many tools, it comes with certain limitations.

If you want to make your video more exciting and different from the rest, you can always go for an external video editor, like Wondershare Filmora, and edit videos on your desktop. I hope our steps on how to create successful Tiktok videos on desktop, Android, and iPhone will come in handy and increase your Tiktok followers!

 Other than this you have soundtrack options and audio adjustment features. You can add the soundtrack of your liking by choosing from the built-in music library to whatever part of the video you prefer again with a single drag and drop. There is all kinds of hot new music available from a vast variety of genres. Moreover, you can remove background noise with the audio adjustment feature and even fix the equalizing, pitch, fade in, fade out, and the speed of the soundtrack.

 Besides this, you can add more features to your video for example slow motion, fast forward, playing the video backwards and even split screen! A split screen is an option in which you can play multiple videos at the same time on the same screen which is also one of the features highly professional video makers use.

 There are multiple video formats available once you are done. Preview your video, click export and easily share it with other social media platforms for example twitter. You can even upload it directly on youtube and choose from different formats available for that. You’re not just restricted to that, you can upload your masterpiece on any social media platform you like even Tik Tok! This will make your videos on Tik Tok stand out as by editing on filmora you can use filters and overlays that are not available on Tik Tok and make your videos unique. This is also a very helpful application for bloggers.

 In the fast-paced and dynamic world of social media, Filmora allows those who aren’t professional but just need an easy way to showcase their creativity and talent on TikTok. These are simple to use and have features available which only professionals had access too at first. So if this is what’s stopping you from becoming a video blogger, let yourself go and download these apps today!
