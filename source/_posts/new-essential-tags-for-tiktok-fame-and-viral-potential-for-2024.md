## Part 3: How to Use TikTok Trending Hashtags Effectively?

Using hashtags for TikTok can be a little tricky. So, here are some tips that will help in getting the optimum results.

### Find Relevant Hashtags

When you browse content from your competitor, check out the hashtags they are using for their viral or popular posts. In case it seems like a hectic process, you can take the help of a hashtag generator tool for finding the right hashtags to use for your content.

### Combine Popular Hashtags on TikTok with the Less Popular Ones

One of the primary benefits of using hashtags is that many people search for them. However, there is fierce competition when it comes to popular hashtags. So, you are more likely to get noticed in a narrower niche when you use less competitive and smaller hashtags.

![combine trending tiktok hashtags](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/combine-popular-tiktok-hashtags.png)

Once you start becoming popular with smaller hashtags, you are likely to climb up the larger hashtag feed. This is the reason you should mix both types of hashtags.

### Follow Trends and Use Current Hashtag

So, you are using a hashtag in December and ‘#merrychristmas’ is a popular hashtag to use. However, there is no point in using the same hashtag in February. Hashtag trends keep rising and falling but it is necessary to ensure that the hashtags you are using your content is current.

### Go for Branded Hashtags

When you create your own branded hashtags, it will help your followers find you. In fact, you can reach out to more users with your branded hashtags on this social media platform in comparison to the other social media platforms.

![branded tiktok hashtags](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/branded-tiktok-hashtags.jpg)

As a matter of fact, if you want, you can come up with your own hashtag challenge. You can challenge your users to develop content and then tag them using your branded hashtag. These challenges work exceptionally well on TikTok as they can get users to inspire each other to develop content.

### The More the Better

Using just one hashtag is not going to help. Every hashtag you use is going to expose you to a different set of audiences. So, use as many hashtags as possible.

TikTok places a limitation of 100 characters. This implies you have to keep the hashtags shorts and simple to fit as many as you can.

Some users tend to use the #hashtag in their comments when they run out of the character limit for the caption. These hashtags might work but they aren’t as effective as the ones you include in the caption. So, make sure that you are adding the important hashtags to the captions.

When you use your **top TikTok hashtags** strategically, you can make the most of the content.

## Part 4: Bonus Tip- Use Powerful Video Editor to Create TikTok Videos

At times, even the most popular TikTok hashtags don’t work. This might be due to the poor quality of the video. In that case, you can use a powerful video creator and editor to create your videos. One such effective video creator is Filmora. With this video editing tool, you can apply motion elements, transitions, filters, and a lot more.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

TikTok is pretty awesome, the next big thing in social media, both for brands and individuals.

Luckily, the lip-sync and dance and app can be a lot more than that if your brand uses it with purpose in mind. And the first place to begin with that aim is in your TikTok bio.

Your bio for TikTok is your best chance to introduce yourself and your brand to each of your potential followers.

It's because you don't want to consume time to introduce yourself in every video, again and again, so your **TikTok bios** provide you with the opportunity to do just that. This is your chance to describe to your followers who you are and why they should be your followers.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)[![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

Here, we'll cover how to add a link to TikTok bio, 30+ TikTok bio ideas, and other fantastic tools to upgrade your TikTok profile.

## Part 1: Optimize Your TikTok Bio in 5 Easy Steps \[updated 2024\]

Writing a TikTok bio doesn't have to be that hard. You have to go through the five easy steps to create a bio for TikTok that will help you be successful. So, let's dig deeper into those ultimate steps!

**Step 1: Describe your brand.**

![describe account tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/describe-account-tiktok.jpg)

Source: blog.hubspot.com

Describe your followers who you are and what you do. They may gather some idea of what your profile is about, based on your content. Still, it would help if you didn't rely on that.

What if you create a video relevant to you but has nothing to do with your account? Your visitors need to learn another way to know what your business is all about.

It can be only a few words, so make sure you boil down what people want to know. And ensure your language is compelling, engaging, and gets across your account's purpose efficiently.

**Step 2: Add emojis.**

Almost every TikTok bio contains an emoji that help you emphasize your brand's personality and showcase your brand's services and products without consuming much space in your TikTok bio.

For example, if you work for an eCommerce brand, particularly in clothing, you might enter a t-shirt emoji (???). Or, if your company sells video tools, you may enter a video camera emoji (???).

So, these emojis tell people what to do. And, if you want them to hit the follow button or click the link below, you could add arrows to express that without entering extra characters to influence visitors' action.

**Step 3: Add a CTA.**

Like any attractive social media bio, you should have a CTA in your TikTok bio as well. It exactly tells your visitors what to do next. For example, you might add a CTA to direct followers to an eCommerce website, a blog post link, or another social channel like YouTube or Instagram.

Always think of including a CTA in almost every video or communication you share with your potential followers.

**Step 4: Don't exceed the character limit**.

TikTok has a bio character limit which is further not very big. So you only have 80 characters to summarize your TikTok bio. That's just over half of the limit present on Instagram handles, which can be pretty tight, one of the factors emojis are super helpful. You can easily save your characters and use them wisely to communicate your brand among the followers fully. Then, pick out the most crucial angles of your brand and showcase those in your TikTok bio.

**Step 5: Add a link in your TikTok bio.**

TikTok gives you a link adding space as well, so if it's currently accessible in your account, you should use it. And, we'll also discuss how to add a link to TikTok's bio, an excellent method to direct traffic off the platform to other promotion pages.

So, you can direct them to a relevant landing page or e-book and capture their contact info or an email address, or you can share the sales page for the most current product you touted in your video.

Thus, there are numerous ways you can optimize your TikTok bio ideas.

## Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?

First, to know how to add a link to TikTok bio, you can send traffic to only a single URL. You can select your most recent blog post, a dedicated landing page, your homepage, social media profile, or any other page you'd like.

The other way is to promote multiple links through a bio service. With this type of service, people can get directed to a web page with a collection of page links to visit.

You could include affiliate links, blog links, products, or even your other social media handles. Using a TikTok bio link service helps you to give your visitors more ways of connecting with people outside of TikTok.

**Accessing the Link in Bio on TikTok**

Yet, there is a caveat to the **TikTok bio** link option: not everyone can add a link to their **TikTok bio**. Most Android users have this option, while some iOS users are still waiting. Follow the steps below to check:

**Step 1**: Hit the **"Edit your profile"** tab

**Step 2**: Check for the option "**Website**" underneath the section to edit TikTok bio.

There's no issue if you don't have that option. You can join the TikTok Testers program by easily downloading a separate app called **Testflight** through the app store.

Next, open your current TikTok app and tap the three dots in your profile page's upper right-hand corner to enter the "**Settings**" window. Then, scroll down and click **"Join TikTok Testers."**

![tiktok beta](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-beta.jpg)

Follow those instructions, and you'll be able to access the different Beta versions of TikTok after they get released. TikTok provides this facility to ensure that only the best features hit the primary app and keep the app as bug-free as possible.

TikTok is pretty awesome, the next big thing in social media, both for brands and individuals.

Luckily, the lip-sync and dance and app can be a lot more than that if your brand uses it with purpose in mind. And the first place to begin with that aim is in your TikTok bio.

Your bio for TikTok is your best chance to introduce yourself and your brand to each of your potential followers.

It's because you don't want to consume time to introduce yourself in every video, again and again, so your **TikTok bios** provide you with the opportunity to do just that. This is your chance to describe to your followers who you are and why they should be your followers.

## Part 1: Optimize Your TikTok Bio in 5 Easy Steps \[updated 2024\]

Writing a TikTok bio doesn't have to be that hard. You have to go through the five easy steps to create a bio for TikTok that will help you be successful. So, let's dig deeper into those ultimate steps!

**Step 1: Describe your brand.**

![describe account tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/describe-account-tiktok.jpg)

Source: blog.hubspot.com

Describe your followers who you are and what you do. They may gather some idea of what your profile is about, based on your content. Still, it would help if you didn't rely on that.

What if you create a video relevant to you but has nothing to do with your account? Your visitors need to learn another way to know what your business is all about.

It can be only a few words, so make sure you boil down what people want to know. And ensure your language is compelling, engaging, and gets across your account's purpose efficiently.

**Step 2: Add emojis.**

Almost every TikTok bio contains an emoji that help you emphasize your brand's personality and showcase your brand's services and products without consuming much space in your TikTok bio.

For example, if you work for an eCommerce brand, particularly in clothing, you might enter a t-shirt emoji (???). Or, if your company sells video tools, you may enter a video camera emoji (???).

So, these emojis tell people what to do. And, if you want them to hit the follow button or click the link below, you could add arrows to express that without entering extra characters to influence visitors' action.

**Step 3: Add a CTA.**

Like any attractive social media bio, you should have a CTA in your TikTok bio as well. It exactly tells your visitors what to do next. For example, you might add a CTA to direct followers to an eCommerce website, a blog post link, or another social channel like YouTube or Instagram.

Always think of including a CTA in almost every video or communication you share with your potential followers.

**Step 4: Don't exceed the character limit**.

TikTok has a bio character limit which is further not very big. So you only have 80 characters to summarize your TikTok bio. That's just over half of the limit present on Instagram handles, which can be pretty tight, one of the factors emojis are super helpful. You can easily save your characters and use them wisely to communicate your brand among the followers fully. Then, pick out the most crucial angles of your brand and showcase those in your TikTok bio.

**Step 5: Add a link in your TikTok bio.**

TikTok gives you a link adding space as well, so if it's currently accessible in your account, you should use it. And, we'll also discuss how to add a link to TikTok's bio, an excellent method to direct traffic off the platform to other promotion pages.

So, you can direct them to a relevant landing page or e-book and capture their contact info or an email address, or you can share the sales page for the most current product you touted in your video.

Thus, there are numerous ways you can optimize your TikTok bio ideas.

## Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?

First, to know how to add a link to TikTok bio, you can send traffic to only a single URL. You can select your most recent blog post, a dedicated landing page, your homepage, social media profile, or any other page you'd like.

The other way is to promote multiple links through a bio service. With this type of service, people can get directed to a web page with a collection of page links to visit.

You could include affiliate links, blog links, products, or even your other social media handles. Using a TikTok bio link service helps you to give your visitors more ways of connecting with people outside of TikTok.

**Accessing the Link in Bio on TikTok**

Yet, there is a caveat to the **TikTok bio** link option: not everyone can add a link to their **TikTok bio**. Most Android users have this option, while some iOS users are still waiting. Follow the steps below to check:

**Step 1**: Hit the **"Edit your profile"** tab

**Step 2**: Check for the option "**Website**" underneath the section to edit TikTok bio.

There's no issue if you don't have that option. You can join the TikTok Testers program by easily downloading a separate app called **Testflight** through the app store.

Next, open your current TikTok app and tap the three dots in your profile page's upper right-hand corner to enter the "**Settings**" window. Then, scroll down and click **"Join TikTok Testers."**

![tiktok beta](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-beta.jpg)

Follow those instructions, and you'll be able to access the different Beta versions of TikTok after they get released. TikTok provides this facility to ensure that only the best features hit the primary app and keep the app as bug-free as possible.

## Part 3: 30+ TikTok Bio Ideas in 2024
