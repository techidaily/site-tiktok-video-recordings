<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 1. Overview section

This section gives information about the views related to the videos, followers, and profile views.

* Video views provide details for the last 7, 28, 60 days about the number of times any video has been watched.
* The 'Followers' area informs you who have joined recently and the total number of followers of your account.
* Profile views: for the selected date range, it gives you a brief idea about the number of profile views done in that duration.

Plus, you will get to know about overall comments, shares, or likes in that period.

Well, the list does not end here.

### 2. Followers section

To make this section work, you must have at least 100 followers. Then, it will show viewers’ demographic-related information such as timings, when users remain least/most active, followers from top 5 countries, growth trend, top videos, top sounds listened to, etc.

### 3. Content Section

This area gives any particular post/video/content in terms of comments, shares, or likes. Also, you will get to know about traffic source, average viewers, user location. It is to note that such information remains available for seven days only.

So, following the Analytics Data, it becomes beneficial to analyze the actual reach of your content to the target audience. It gives you an idea that which area needs improvement; thus, you can update the content accordingly.
