Step 3: Click the speed icon, and then select 1.5X or 2X to speed up the video when watching.

### Method 2: Speed Up TikTok Video Playback on Computer

Step 1: Open the TikTok app on your Windows computer, move the cursor to your profile picture, and select **View Profile**.

Step 2: Choose the video you want to speed up the playback speed on TikTok.

Step 3: Using the right button on your mouse, right-click on the video and choose **Show All Controls** on the pop-up window.

![tiktok on computer show all controls](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-on-computer-show-all-controls.jpg)
