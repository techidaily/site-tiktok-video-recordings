Whether you love it or hate it, you must have heard about an App in 2020 - TikTok. Due to the outbreak of Covid-19, TikTok became one of the fastest-growing apps on both the App Store and Google Play. Teenagers are obsessed with it, but their parents donâ€™t understand it.

The growing uncertainties of TikTok has driven so many users to look for **TikTok alternatives**.
