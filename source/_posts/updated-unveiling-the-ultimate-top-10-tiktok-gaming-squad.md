2. Once the editing interface of the photo is opened, you can go to its Exposure field and set it to its maximum value, which is 100 (please note that this is an optional step).
3. Great! Now, go to the “Highlights” field and set its value to negative 35.
4. Afterward, change the “Shadow” effect to a negative 28 value and keep the “Contrast” value to minus 30.
