## Part 1: What is TikTok Creator Fund?

TikTok’s Creator Fund program is a $200 million cash fund, growing to $1billion over the next 3 years, to reward TikTokers for creating authentic, entertaining, and engaging video content. Launched in 2020, the TikTok creator fund is the opportunity of a lifetime for determined video creators to earn per view on their original content.

From artists to educators, singers to dancers, comedians to bodybuilders, the TikTok creator fund allows the brightest TikTokers to earn money through their creative content. It is a type of incentive for the creators and a way for TikTok to express their gratitude to the creator community for their creativity and ingenuity. The goal of the fund is to support the brightest and best TikTok creators who draw audiences to the platform.

## Part 2: Who is Eligible to Apply to the Creator Fund?

TikTokers can apply for funding through the creator fund and generate income from their videos. Although there’s no limit on the number of creators who can join, there are certain TikTok creator fund requirements that creators have to meet to be able to access the program.

The initial criteria for applying to the TikTok creator fund are:

* Must be at least 18 years of age
* Should have at least 10, 000 followers

In other words, the creator fund is for content creators who have already proven their ability to make popular content. If you do not meet the above requirements, you won’t be able to access the creator fund or the income it provides.
