## Method 1: Save TikTok Video by the TikTok App Itself

Unlike other apps, TikTok is well aware of our wants and likes. Since we youngsters are the obsessive kind, we love to rewatch our favorite videos countless times until we get bored or move on to the next. Hence TikTok has an in-built option to save TikTok videos to any device, be it a Smartphone or a PC. Better yet, you don't even need to own a TikTok account to save videos. Just install the app and follow these steps. Easy peasy.

1\. Once installed, launch TikTok.

2\. Press the arrow icon('share to' button) on the bottom right.

## Part 1: Prerequisite for Live Stream on TikTok from PC

To start TikTok live streaming on your PC, there are some pre-requirements. These requirements are necessary to prevent the misuse of TikTok by any means. Once you have fulfilled these requirements, you can easily go for live streaming on TikTok without any restrictions.

* To enable the live stream feature on TikTok, you must have at least 1000 followers on your account.
* You should be above 16 years old to access this feature. Moreover, to increase your engagement during live streams by sending virtual gifts, you should be 18 years old or above.
* To begin live streaming on a PC using streaming software, you must have a streaming key and server URL.

### How to Get your Streaming Key on TikTok?

A streaming key is a random combination of alphanumeric characters. It helps you to connect your TikTok account with a streaming platform to enable high-quality results. To get your streaming key in the easiest way, check the following steps:

Step1 Open your TikTok app to begin the process. Select the "Plus" icon and choose the "Live" button from the right side. Afterward, choose the "Cast/Connect to PC/Mac" option to proceed.

![choose live option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/12/tiktok-live-from-computer-1.jpg)

Step2 Now tap on the "Go Live" option that will open a new window. Now you can see your Stream Key and Server URL. Press the "Copy" option given next to these two options. Afterward, you can share your stream key and server URL with your PC, which will be used later.
