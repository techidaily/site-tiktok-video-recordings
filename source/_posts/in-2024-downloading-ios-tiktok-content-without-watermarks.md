Changing username for your Tiktok account isn’t difficult, but you must keep in mind that the username gets attached in every post or video that you post from your account. In other words, the username becomes the brand name for your TikTok videos.

Hence, be cautious that your username isn’t of a standard type because Tiktok allows you to change it once in 30 days only. You would not be able to change it in between. Another factor why a username change is difficult in Tiktok is because Tiktok is very mindful of online safety. A separate team at Tiktok ensures that the account is real and not a fraud or scam.

Now, there are some rules that a Tiktok user must maintain before proceeding to username creation. Here is the list:

* Avoid using your mail address in place of the username as both are completely for different purpose.
* You should carefully avoid using personal details such as full name, address, or phone number can be avoided as username. Country Names are preferable but don’t go off grainy.
* Never try a username that could get traced to find your account password.
* Avoid usage of inappropriate usernames.
* Avoiding generic names, rather something weird or off the book that can stay at the back of your audience’s head.
* You can let the username be related to your content or intentions.
* If your account is business-based, make an identity based on the brand.

Have you decided on a username for your Tiktok account, and are ready to change it? Well, then here is a step-by-step guide on **how to change your Tiktok username.**

**Step 1**: In your smartphone, open the TikTok application. Log on to your account if not logged in.

**Step 2**: Hit on the icon from the bottom of the main menu screen.

 **Step 3**: Now you need to visit the “Edit Profile” option.

 **Step 4:** Click on the “Username” option.

**Step 5**: Enter the new username by deleting the old one.

**Step 6**: Hit the “Save” button.

It just takes a couple of minutes to change your Tiktok username.

Do note that if the name isn’t registered before in the database, you can begin, but if the username is already available, you will get notified and you would have to try out another.

1. **Get Inspired by Creative and Cool Usernames**

So, you now know **how to change the Tiktok username**, and do you have any idea on how to proceed further. There are different types of tiktokers, and their interest is what makes the difference. Here are some fresh and exciting username suggestions from which you can choose and build your own based on it.

If you are a motivational tiktoker, try Bean secrets, Elite, cubicle force, Haughty leaders, and Open book. For professional tiktoker, it is the bridge connect, business preachers, capitalist crew, innovation geeks, and passionate entrepreneurs.

Are you an art or music lover? Dream makers, Icon lover, viola, craft lady, and lasting beauty are some username ideas for you. Especially for makeup tiktokers, Queen hood, butterfly on rose, glowing gold, doll diamond, and bubbles are unbeatable.

As for rocking game tiktokers, we have electric players, which are aggressively new, extreme, ever since never, flame, gaming changing, life racer, and no limits on hand.

If you are tired of thinking one, then online username generators like Jimpix and LastPass can lend you a hand.

1. **Conclusion**

I believe that you would have now come to know what a good username can do to your Tiktok account and **how to change the Tiktok username**. Username can either build your account else shatter it too. In the increasing competition among Tiktokers, the username is the first-sight impressions that bring your account popularity and make them a shining star in the sky of tokers. But one has to be careful that the username created is within the scope of the rules and never a threat to the public or the other Tiktok users. So, for what are you waiting for, Tiktoker? Think of a new username for your account and wait for your account to get noticed by millions of audiences around the world.
