## Scripting the Final Push for Your TikTok Series

If you're just getting started on TikTok, you might be wondering why people bother with TikTok outros. After all, they're just a few seconds of a clip at the end of your videos. Why not just let the video end and move on?

Well, TikTok outros are actually a really important part of the platform. They're a great way to promote your other social media platforms, give your viewers a call to action, or just show off your personality.

![create outros for tiktok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/create-outros-for-tiktok.png)

In this article, we'll show you how to **create an outro for TikTok** that is sure to leave an ever-lasting impression on those watching your content. In the end, we'll recommend the best video editors that you can use to make your videos engaging by creating the perfect outros every time.

## Part 1\. Basic Things You Should Know About the Outro in a Video

The outro is the last section of the video where the credits are displayed, such as the name of the creator, the date the video was created, and any other relevant information.

An outro is a good chance to thank your viewers for watching, promote your other videos or social channels, and maybe even sneak in a call-to-action.

Basically, the outro is the last thing your viewers will see, so it's important to make it count!

![outros template](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/outros-template.png)

### Elements of an Outro

Here are a few basic elements to include in your outro to keep people engaged:

* **Subscription:** Make it easy for people to subscribe to your TikTok account so they can automatically get new content as soon as it's released. Include a call-to-action at the end of each video, telling people how they can subscribe and get the latest content.
* **The Next Video to Watch:** If you have other episodes/parts of your TikTok videos, let people know what to expect next. This will give them a reason to come back for more.
* **Your Social Media Channels:** Let people know where they can find you on other social media platforms so they can connect with you outside of TikTok. This is a great way to build relationships with your viewers.
* **Use Stunning Visuals:** Usually, viewers skip outros just like any movie credits showing on a black screen with names on it. However, if you try to create a short TikTok outro with stunning visuals, impressive background sound, and a bit of flair, you are bound to get more followers.

### How To Make an Advanced Good Outro?

If you want your TikTok video to go viral, you are required to have a good outro, meaning that you need to have a format that is consistent with the main body of your video, a length that is appropriate, and a call to action that is effective.

To **create a good outro for your TikTok**, follow the below tips:

* Make sure that your outro is in the same format as the rest of your TikTok video. This means that if your TikTok is mainly conversation, your outro should be as well.
* Keep your outro short and sweet because you don't want to bore your listeners with a long one. The ideal outro duration should not be more than 15 to 20 seconds.
* Your outro should include a call to action. This could be something like asking your listeners to subscribe to your TikTok, follow, and share your content.
* Make your outros visually appealing and make use of colors and/or patterns that are pleasing to the eye.
* Add positive words and phrases to your outros to have a good impact on your viewers.
* Use branding elements like your logo or channel name.

## Part 2\. An Excellent Video Editor for Your TikTok Adventure

While popular culture and many influencers might have you believe that TikTok is all about kids lip-syncing to pop songs, there's so much more to this social media platform. Recently, it has become a powerful marketing tool for small to mid-sized businesses.

The best way to use TikTok's platform for marketing is to create engaging outros for your videos. For this, you'll need video editing software like Filmora and a little creative mind. With this program, you can easily add text, music, and effects to your TikTok clips to make them truly stand out.

## Part 1: All You Need to Know about TikTok

TikTok, which is owned by ByteDance, is one of the most popular social media platforms in the world.

The app has surpassed 2 billion global downloads with most of its users from the United States, Southeast Asia, South Asia, Russia, Turkey, and Japan.

The app is majorly focused on creating short video-based content and sharing it with others on the platform. Users can directly record their videos, add media content (like soundtracks), apply filters, and do so much more.

## Part 2: How to Use Cool TikTok Photo Editing Hacks?

Most of the TikTok users only take the assistance of the app to edit their videos on the go. Though, a **TikTok picture edit trend** is lately going viral on the social media platform.

The best part is that the popular TikTok photo edit hack is super-easy to implement and can drastically change the overall visual appeal of your pictures. The hack would make your photos look more vibrant and colorful while still maintaining their authenticity. Here’s how you can also implement this TikTok iPhone photo editing hack without any hassle:

1. At first, you can just go to the Photos app, open any picture, and click on the “Edit” button from the top.
2. Once the editing interface of the photo is opened, you can go to its Exposure field and set it to its maximum value, which is 100 (please note that this is an optional step).
3. Great! Now, go to the “Highlights” field and set its value to negative 35.
4. Afterward, change the “Shadow” effect to a negative 28 value and keep the “Contrast” value to minus 30.

1. Now, you can set the “Brightness” value to minus 5 and the “Back Point” value to exact 10.
2. You are almost there. You can now put the “Saturation” value to 10 and keep its “Vibrance” level to 8.
3. Furthermore, go to the “Warmth” field and keep it to 10 while its “Tint” value has to be set to 39.
4. Besides that, you also have to set its “Sharpness” count to 14 and the “Vignette” value to 23.

![tiktok photo editing trend](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-photo-editing-trend.jpg)

In case you have set the Exposure field to 100 (the optional step), then you need to set the Brilliance and Exposure value to 0 in the end. That’s it! After following this viral TikTok photo editing hack, you can get that perfect sun-kissed picture.

## Part 3: Viral TikTok Photo/Video Trends You Should Know

While this TikTok photo editing hack has been quite popular, the social media platform has given rise to tons of other trends as well. Here are some of these popular TikTok video/photo editing trends that you can explore.

#### 1\. Runaway by Aurora Trend

This is one of the most aesthetically pleasing trends that has been all over TikTok in 2021\. In this, the popular song Runaway by Aurora is played in the background and the inbuilt TikTok filter is used. It will freeze the frame while recording the video and would automatically change the background to make it look appealing.

#### 2\. Fake Window Trend

The Fake Window trend has been on TikTok for a while now and would only need a projector. As the name suggests, you just have to use a projector to display all kinds of images on a wall or a curtain (making it look like a window). Go ahead and unleash your creative ideas for some stunning video projections and post them on TikTok.

#### 3\. Questions I Get Asked… Trend

TikTok keeps hosting tons of popular trends and this one is no such exception. In this, people simply post videos in which they share some peculiar questions that they get asked a lot. The trend became extremely popular, and you would find the experience of other TikTok users quite funny.

#### 4\. Outfit Challenge

Lastly, this is the most popular ongoing trend on TikTok that you can also explore. In this, people simply pose with some of their best outfits with a trendy song playing in the background. Therefore, if you are into fashion, then this would be one of the best TikTok trends to explore.
