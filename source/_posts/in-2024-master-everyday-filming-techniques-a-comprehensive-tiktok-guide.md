Although there is no method to delete the duet videos that others have created with you, yes, you can prevent it in the future by using app settings. By doing this, you are keeping your profile publicly visible, but you are not allowing other people to create a duet with you. If you want to do such settings; go through the steps below.

### How to prevent people from creating duet videos with you?

Step 1: First of all, open the app and then go to privacy settings.

Step 2: Now move to the Safety option.

Step 3: Click on the option “Who Can Duet With Me.” Now you can choose the suitable option out of “Everyone,” “Friends” or simply “Off.” The last option doesn’t allow anyone to make duet videos with you; however, the second one allows only mutual followers to create videos with you.
