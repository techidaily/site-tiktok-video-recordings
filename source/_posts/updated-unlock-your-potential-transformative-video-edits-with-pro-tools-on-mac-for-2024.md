## Part 2: How to Make Reaction Videos with Filmora

Even though you can make **TikTok reaction videos** using its own filters and audio mixing tools that work pretty well under ideal conditions, if you are a perfectionist and like precision in anything you do or create, you need a dedicated program that has been designed specifically for the purpose.

Although several such tools are available in the market and can be easily downloaded and used, the best among them is Filmora by Wondershare. Wondershare Filmora is an industry-standard production and post-production tool for both Mac and Windows PCs that the majority of users prefer over its competitors such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro X, etc. This is because Filmora offers simple UI, is less resource-intensive, and is able to render the outputs significantly faster.

You can learn how to make **TikTok reaction videos**  using Wondershare Filmora by following the steps given below:

**Note:**  Before proceeding, make sure that you have already copied the source (and the reaction) video(s) from your smartphone to your computer.

### 1\. Create New Project and Set Preferences

Start Wondershare Filmora on your Windows or Mac PC, go to **File**  \> **New Project** and click **9:16 (Portrait)**  from the submenu that appears.

Click **Split Screen** from the standard toolbar at the top, hover mouse to the screen type preset you want to use, click the **\+**  (**Add to Project**) icon that appears at the bottom-right corner of the thumbnail, and click **OK**  from the bottom-right corner once the preset is added to the Timeline.

### 2\. Import and Add Video(s) Preview/Timeline

Click the **Media** button from the standard toolbar, click anywhere inside the **Media** window at the upper-left corner, and when the **Open** box comes up, select and import the video file(s) you want to participate in the **TikTok reaction**. Alternatively, you can also click **Record** from below the standard toolbar, and choose any of the options to record your own video or voice right from within Wondershare Filmora itself.

Next, click and drag each of the imported videos to their corresponding screen sections in the **Preview** window in the upper-right area. Notice how the files are automatically added to the Timeline at the bottom.

### 3\. Add Elements and Titles

Click **Elements** from the standard toolbar, hover mouse to the element you want to add to the reaction, click the **\+**  icon that appears at the center of the thumbnail, and reposition the element in the Timeline to match the duration with that of the reaction you are creating.

### 4\. Export the Reaction

![Filmora9  export options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-video.jpg)

Click **EXPORT**  from the top-middle section of the interface, go to the **Local** tab from the top of the **Export** box that appears next, select your preferred format from the left bar, optionally choose a destination folder from the right window, optionally click **SETTINGS**  to fine-tune the output preferences as needed, and click **EXPORT**  from the bottom-right corner to export the **TikTok reaction**. Or, you can save it in the settings perfect for iPhone or another device.

Below is a sample reaction video made with Filmora, you can do much better than that for your TikTok account:

Besides using Filmora to edit reaction videos with the split-screen presets, you can also use some other [video editing software to create a reaction video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Filmora can empower your video creation with more creativity, watch the video below and download Filmora to try.

**Conclusion**

A **TikTok reaction** enables you to make the source videos more fun and entertaining. Luckily the app itself has a “React” button that helps you create **TikTok reaction videos** with merely a few simple taps. However, if you feel that the built-in options are not as robust as they should be, a third-party program like Wondershare Filmora is something you would definitely love to try your hands on as the software is not only easy to use, it is also lightweight, and doesn’t put any overhead on your computer hardware.
