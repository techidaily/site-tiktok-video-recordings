### Spot Up-and-Coming Trends

The TikTok algorithm doesnâ€™t curate trends and thus, whatever you find on the For Your Page is a mix of trending videos. But remember, the trends donâ€™t last for more than 5-7 days.

### Follow Trending Creators

One of the best ways to find new trends is to follow all trending creators who jump on the latest trends.

### Conclusion

New TikTok trends are being introduced every day. So, make sure you keep a check. To create your TikTok videos, you can use the Filmora editing tool and make use of its features.
