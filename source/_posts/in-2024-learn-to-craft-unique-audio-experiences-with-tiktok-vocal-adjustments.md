## Part 1: How to Record Tik Tok Video Wit Slow Motion Effects?

TikTok videos may benefit from adding effects, which is a simple process. You may do it during the recording process or after the fact in post-production. One viral effect is slow-motion. You can use this to create some quite amusing videos, particularly when combined with other effects.

In this section, we'll go through how to record a TikTok video with the slow-mo effect.

**Step 1**: The first step is to **Open Tik Tok**, which can be accomplished by searching for the program on your smartphone. When you first launch TikTok, it will open in the feed area by default, as seen below. Navigation to the new video screen requires one press on the **\+ symbol** at the bottom of your screen, as seen in the image below before it will appear.

![tiktok record video button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-record-video-button.jpg)

**Note**: You will be taken to the recording area, where your phone's camera will be launched immediately.

**Step 2:** When you first access the new video area, a bar displaying the various recording speeds displays, as seen in the screenshot below. It is necessary to pick the slowest feasible speed.

**Tip:** You may also select the video's pace based on your preferences and how sluggish you want to make the movie seem.

![tiktok video recording speed option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-video-recording-speed-option.jpg)

**Step 3:** Next to selecting the desired speed, you must go to the following screen. It is possible to see a **Check Mark** option appear in the right-hand corner of the screen, as seen in the illustration. Tap on it once to advance to the next stage.

**Step** **4:** Then, go to the next step after selecting the desired speed. As seen below, you must record the video by **Tapping and Holding the Red Color Record button** for some time.

**Note**: Once the video has been recorded and is in a slower speed, it will automatically be recorded in slow motion. You can use this method to record your TikTok videos with a slow-motion effect.

## Part 2: How o Add Slow-Mo Effects After Recording Videos on Tik Tok?

What about the videos you have already recorded on your TikTok application? Can you slow them down too? The following steps illustrate how to apply a slow-motion effect to your TikTok videos once they have been recorded using the app.

It is simple to record a video by simply going to the "Add new" area and selecting the video of your choosing to record. When you've finished recording, choose the next choice from the drop-down menu. Following that, you may proceed with the procedure.

**Step 1**: Once you've arrived at the next screen, you'll need to click on the **Circular clock** symbol to activate the effect. It is located in the bottom left corner of the screen, as seen below.

**Tip:** To access it, click on it. To access the effects, tap on it once. The effects under the **Filter** effects section will be immediately activated.
