## Tips to Create Trending Videos on TikTok

To make sure that your videos on TikTok are trending, you can take the help of a few tips listed below.

![tiktok web](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/tiktok-web.jpg)

### 1. Post a Video At Least Once Every Day

The platform expects its successful creators to post videos often. In case you wish to go viral, you need to create enough content for people to notice you. If you would like to create a low-profile, your profile might not appear often in the user’s feed.

The top accounts release videos several times every day. However, this level of production might be difficult for one person without compromising on the video’s quality. So, upload at least one video every day.

### 2. Make Sure the Videos are of High-Quality

The importance of this cannot be emphasized enough. TikTok is all about trending videos. Hence, you have to make sure that you are sharing footage of top-notch quality. Yes, you might have to upload videos daily, but that doesn’t mean you should sacrifice quality for quantity. For this, however, you don’t have to employ a professional camera operator. You can create videos using your smartphone and then edit them using good software. This ensures that you make videos that will go viral. You can use an external microphone if the sound is an essential component.

### 3. Do Not Ignore Sounds

One of the primary differences of TikTok has been the liberty that it gives you to use music in the videos that people are sharing. It is incredibly easy to add music to your 15-seconds video on this platform. TikTok has made arrangements with the top music companies to get permission to use the copyrighted music extracts.

You will be able to add music tracks to your videos without any hassle from the app itself.

### 4. Use Trending Hashtags to Keep Up with the Trends

When you open the TikTok app and tap on the ‘Discover’ button present at the bottom, it is going to show the trending hashtags. It is better to emulate some posts which you see on the ‘Discover’ page if you want the videos to trend on TikTok.

The trending hashtags change on a regular basis and tend to be region-specific.

Making videos about frogs or bears might not be your thing, especially when you do not have access to either animal. So, you need to look for trending hashtags that will be more relevant to your audience.

### 5. Showcase Your Skills in the Video

In case you are looking for content ideas for the videos, you should ask yourself the skill you have. Several Tiktokers create videos of them doing something that they are good at. This can be playing an instrument, skateboarding, or playing a sport like fire-eating or juggling. There are many dancers that showcase their skills in lip-sync videos. Hence, you need to recognize your skill and use it to make your videos.

#### Conclusion

To make your videos stand out from the rest, you should [download FilmoraX on your Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and use it to edit your videos. The software comes with different effects and features that you can use to make your videos go viral. You don’t it for free on your device and start using it immediately.

Do not underestimate TikTok’s importance. The audience might be predominantly young, but it is aging with the platform. Hence, there are a considerable number of them. In case you are able to create trending videos, you can take it to be a notable success.
