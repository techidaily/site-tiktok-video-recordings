**Record Voiceover and Add it to Video**

We suggest you record the voiceover first in most cases so the sound will become pretty natural.

**Step 1: Connect Microphone to PC or laptop**

Connect the microphone to your laptop/PC when you're ready to begin. It's advisable to use some professional external microphones to capture high-quality sound.

**Step 2: Record voiceover**

Tap the **Wondershare Filmora** icon to launch this software. Then, select the New **Project** option in the beginning interface to create a new one.

Enter the **Record** tab and choose the "**Record a Voiceover”** option to arouse the **Record Audio** windows.

Or hit the **microphone** icon, and you only need 3 seconds of countdown to begin speaking.

Click the microphone icon again after you finish the above. Then, a new **Record** file option will be automatically present on the audio track.

**Step 3: Edit Recorded Voiceover to Video**

To edit the recorded voiceover, you can adjust audio settings, such as changing the Speed, Pitch, Volume, etc.
