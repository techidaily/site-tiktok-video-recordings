You can also use the video without the background as an intermediate layer on top of another video. Follow the below steps to change the video background using this feature:

**Step 1: Import Video to Timeline**

Launch Filmora on your Windows PC or Mac, and then import the video to the timeline by clicking on the **File** and then **Import Media**.

**Step 2: Apply Human Segmentation**

Go to **Effects** and then select the **AI Portrait** to see all of the AI Portrait effects. Move the human segmentation effect to the video timeline.

**Step 3: Adjust the Effect Setting (Optional)**

In the preview window, you'll notice that the subject has been separated from the video background. If necessary, double-click the video in the timeline and find the video effect field to modify the edge, thickness, and feather. You can also try the neon borders and glowing flow effects under the AI Portrait category to have some fun.

**Conclusion**

To lure the viewer's attention, there is always a necessity to create visual and audio effects in a TikTok video. A TikTok video maker may not always have the privilege of the ideal location and surroundings to make a video stand out in the vast online market. A simple way out is to use software-based simulation, which means replacing the video background with the required one rather than the original. After reading the article, we hope that you don't have any concerns about how to change the TikTok video background.
