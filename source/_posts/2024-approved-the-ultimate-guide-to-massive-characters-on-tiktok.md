## Sonic Sieve: Extracting Pure Audio in Audacity

The most frequent request you'll get from video makers is to eliminate irritating noises like rumbling or humming from an original clip. Almost all of the time, capturing high-quality audio during filming is challenging since the conversation is often hard to hear or is made unclear due to surrounding noises, such as the dreadful air conditioners or fans.

To get rid of all these awful noises, this **Audacity Noise Reduction** feature will serve you a significant purpose in removing unwanted background noise for your future videos. Without further ado, let's get started!

#### In this article

01 [Things You Need to Prepare for Background Noise Reduction](#part1)

02 [How to Remove Background Noise in Audacity?](#part2)

03 [Why is Audacity Noise Reduction Not Working?](#part3)

04 [How to Prevent Background Noise in Audio Recording?](#part4)

05 [How to Remove Background Noise in Filmora?](#part5)

## Part 1: Things You Need to Prepare for Background Noise Reduction

Here are few things that you need to consider before you apply the noise reduction to your clips:

**1\. Noise Sample**

A decent sample of the noise you wish to eliminate is perhaps the most crucial aspect of **the Audacity remove noise** procedure.

This will be used by Audacity to understand the noise and build a noise profile. The noise recording should last for a fair amount of time and be devoid of any other noises.

**2\. Avoid Copy Pasting Tiny Noise Section in Your Spoken Phrases**

When you have a tiny part of noise between your stated words on your audio, please don't copy/paste it to make a more significant piece of sound for Audacity to examine.

You would not be supplying Audacity with any more information that will help it generate a decent noise profile. The noise profile is what enables Audacity to tell the difference between speech and noise.

**3\. Minimum 2048 Data Samples Required**

To build a noise profile, the Noise Reduction function requires a minimum of 2048 sample data. An audio file with a sampling frequency of 44.1kHz is roughly five hundredths of a second.

Note that this is the minor sound level that Audacity needs to generate a noise profile; however, should you supply a larger sample of the noise, Audacity can typically perform a great job of producing a suitable noise profile. As a result, attempt to capture a few seconds of background noises wherever possible.

**4\. Establish Recording Level and Record "Silence"**

Setting your audio volume and capturing some "quiet" prior to speaking is the best way to achieve this. Instead, when you've finished talking, keep your camera/recorder going for a few moments.

Don't move or create any sounds while capturing the background noises, and keep an ear open for any other noises. You only need to capture the ambient noise for a few moments; two to five seconds will suffice.

## Part 2: How to Remove Background Noise in Audacity on Windows and Mac?

Whether you are using Windows or macOS, we will show you a step-by-step process to achieve your results using both software in this part of Audacity remove background music guide.

**Remove background noise in Audacity on Windows**

**Step 1**: On your recording, select a few moments of sound. Any segment of noise that incorporates other noises should be avoided.

![Audacity remove bg noise](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-audio-clip-without-background-noise.jpg)

**Step 2**: From the **Effect** menu, select **Noise Reduction.**

![Audacity remove noise option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-effect-noise-reduction-option.jpg)

**Step 3**: Select the **Get Noise Profile** option whenever the **Noise Reduction** effect screen appears.

![Audacity get noise profile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-get-noise-profile-option.jpg)

**Note:** Choose whether to implement the noise removal to the entire waveforms or only a portion of it.

**Step 4**: To access the **Noise Reduction** effects window, go to **Effects > Noise Reduction.** Raise the level of noise reduction progressively while previewing the result.

![Audacity noise reduction level](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-noise-reduction-level-audacity.jpg)

**Step 5**: Head over to the **File** section to **Export** and **Save** the result. Audacity does not save sound clips when you select **Save Project**; instead, you must choose **Export**. Select the file type you want to store and the place wherever you can save it. Select **Save** after giving the **File Name**.

![Audacity export without noise](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/export-audio-without-noise-audacity.jpg)

**Remove background noise in Audacity on Mac**

**Step 1:** Create a room tone-containing audio file. When you don't have a separate track for room tone, use a recording with a few moments of quiet in it. Click-and-drag to select a segment with a few minutes of silence using the **Selection Tool**.

![Audacity silence moment selection](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-silent-moment-audacity.jpg)

**Step 2:** Select **Noise Reduction** from the **Effects** tab. Select the **Get Noise Profile** tab in the new tab under **_Step 1_**. The screen will shut, and **Audacity** will take noise profile samples of the indicated area.

![Audacity get noise profile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/get-noise-profile-audacity-mac.jpg)

**Step 3:** Click-and-drag to select the whole file, which requires noise reduction with the **Selection Tool**. To re-open the function, go to the **Effect** tab and pick **Noise Reduction**. Make modifications to the following parameters under Step 2:

* Reduce and Residue
* Frequency Smoothing (bands)
* Sensitivity
* Noise Reduction

![remove bg noise in Audacity mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remove-background-noise-audacity-mac.jpg)

**Step 4:** To listen to how the chosen file will look with the selected parameters, select **Preview**. Re-adjust until you have a sound noise reduction with no interference. When you're finished, select **Reduce** and click **OK.**

## Part 3: Why is Audacity Noise Reduction Not Working?

It's possible that the Noise Reduction function isn't letting you mop up your recording since your audio isn't appropriate for it. The disturbance must be continuous, not random or fluctuating, to work for Audacity's Noise Reduction function.

For example, the Noise Reduction function will not assist if your audio was made in a busy environment with unique noises such as background chatter, random traffic noises, or in an exhibition space or museum. The Noise Reduction feature in Audacity isn't meant to cope with that kind of distortion. You'll need to alter your recording approach if you're capturing voice in either of those situations.

**Under the following situations, the Audacity Noise Reduction function might underperform.**

* Particular noise in the background, including traffic or people.
* When the harmonics of the sound and voice are comparable.
* There is sound variance where there is fluctuation in the noise.
* The volume of the voice is comparable to or lower than that of the background noise.
* When the noise is irregular or changeable rather than continuous.
* The loudness is deafening.
* The sound is a single click or pop.

## Part 4: How to Prevent Background Noise in Audio Recording?

Although Audacity allows eliminating noise very simply, it is still an additional level that takes time to refine your podcast production. These pointers can help you avoid the necessity for noise reduction and cut down on the amount of time you spend processing.

**1\. Reduce the Computer Fan Noise**

Whenever computers become too heated, they can produce a lot of noise. You may limit the amount of software that runs and position your mic away from the keyboard to help lessen this impact and avoid the fan from coming on.

However, even if you observe all of these guidelines, undesired recording sounds may still appear in your program. Fortunately, contemporary software makes this problem quite simple to resolve.

**2\. Reduce the Gain and Get Close to the Mic**

Reduce the gain (sensitivity of the microphone) and go nearer to it. Talking straight into the microphone won't distort your audio if you reduce the gain, and that would assist your microphone in concentrating on scooping up your voice's tone.

**Bonus Tip**: Set your recorder's (or DAW's) sensitivity such that your speech peaks between -12 and -10db.

**3\. Utilize a Versatile Microphone**

Condenser and dynamic microphones are the two most common types of podcast microphones. Condenser microphones are significantly more sensitive instruments meant to take up average atmospheric noise, whereas dynamic microphones have a narrower frequency range, picking up fewer ambient noises.

**4\. Optimize Your Recording Environment**

The most significant and most crucial aspect of your podcasts' sound quality is where you capture it. To optimize your personal podcasting space, we recommend choosing a peaceful, compact area away from HVAC systems, vehicles, external hard drives, background sound, motors, and other distractions. You may also increase the tone of your room by using natural sound absorbents such as curtains, rugs, carpets, and sofas.

## Part 5: How to Remove Background Noise in Filmora?

Although there is a lot of software available to eliminate ambient noise, we highly suggest Wondershare Filmora Video Editor to edit audio and video in one place.

In addition to the standard audio editing capabilities, the recently redesigned Filmora currently includes enhanced waveforms, [volume Keyframing](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), peak metering, and audio transitions, giving you a better audio editing interface.

**Remove background noise in Audacity on Mac**

**Step 1:** Create a room tone-containing audio file. When you don't have a separate track for room tone, use a recording with a few moments of quiet in it. Click-and-drag to select a segment with a few minutes of silence using the **Selection Tool**.

![Audacity silence moment selection](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-silent-moment-audacity.jpg)

**Step 2:** Select **Noise Reduction** from the **Effects** tab. Select the **Get Noise Profile** tab in the new tab under **_Step 1_**. The screen will shut, and **Audacity** will take noise profile samples of the indicated area.

**Step 3:** Click-and-drag to select the whole file, which requires noise reduction with the **Selection Tool**. To re-open the function, go to the **Effect** tab and pick **Noise Reduction**. Make modifications to the following parameters under Step 2:

* Reduce and Residue
* Frequency Smoothing (bands)
* Sensitivity
* Noise Reduction

![remove bg noise in Audacity mac](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/remove-background-noise-audacity-mac.jpg)

**Step 4:** To listen to how the chosen file will look with the selected parameters, select **Preview**. Re-adjust until you have a sound noise reduction with no interference. When you're finished, select **Reduce** and click **OK.**

## Part 3: Why is Audacity Noise Reduction Not Working?

It's possible that the Noise Reduction function isn't letting you mop up your recording since your audio isn't appropriate for it. The disturbance must be continuous, not random or fluctuating, to work for Audacity's Noise Reduction function.

For example, the Noise Reduction function will not assist if your audio was made in a busy environment with unique noises such as background chatter, random traffic noises, or in an exhibition space or museum. The Noise Reduction feature in Audacity isn't meant to cope with that kind of distortion. You'll need to alter your recording approach if you're capturing voice in either of those situations.

**Under the following situations, the Audacity Noise Reduction function might underperform.**

* Particular noise in the background, including traffic or people.
* When the harmonics of the sound and voice are comparable.
* There is sound variance where there is fluctuation in the noise.
* The volume of the voice is comparable to or lower than that of the background noise.
* When the noise is irregular or changeable rather than continuous.
* The loudness is deafening.
* The sound is a single click or pop.

## Part 4: How to Prevent Background Noise in Audio Recording?

Although Audacity allows eliminating noise very simply, it is still an additional level that takes time to refine your podcast production. These pointers can help you avoid the necessity for noise reduction and cut down on the amount of time you spend processing.

**1\. Reduce the Computer Fan Noise**

Whenever computers become too heated, they can produce a lot of noise. You may limit the amount of software that runs and position your mic away from the keyboard to help lessen this impact and avoid the fan from coming on.

However, even if you observe all of these guidelines, undesired recording sounds may still appear in your program. Fortunately, contemporary software makes this problem quite simple to resolve.

**2\. Reduce the Gain and Get Close to the Mic**

Reduce the gain (sensitivity of the microphone) and go nearer to it. Talking straight into the microphone won't distort your audio if you reduce the gain, and that would assist your microphone in concentrating on scooping up your voice's tone.

**Bonus Tip**: Set your recorder's (or DAW's) sensitivity such that your speech peaks between -12 and -10db.

**3\. Utilize a Versatile Microphone**

Condenser and dynamic microphones are the two most common types of podcast microphones. Condenser microphones are significantly more sensitive instruments meant to take up average atmospheric noise, whereas dynamic microphones have a narrower frequency range, picking up fewer ambient noises.

**4\. Optimize Your Recording Environment**

The most significant and most crucial aspect of your podcasts' sound quality is where you capture it. To optimize your personal podcasting space, we recommend choosing a peaceful, compact area away from HVAC systems, vehicles, external hard drives, background sound, motors, and other distractions. You may also increase the tone of your room by using natural sound absorbents such as curtains, rugs, carpets, and sofas.

## Part 5: How to Remove Background Noise in Filmora?

Although there is a lot of software available to eliminate ambient noise, we highly suggest Wondershare Filmora Video Editor to edit audio and video in one place.

05 [How to Remove Background Noise in Filmora?](#part5)

## Part 1: Things You Need to Prepare for Background Noise Reduction

Here are few things that you need to consider before you apply the noise reduction to your clips:

**1\. Noise Sample**

A decent sample of the noise you wish to eliminate is perhaps the most crucial aspect of **the Audacity remove noise** procedure.

This will be used by Audacity to understand the noise and build a noise profile. The noise recording should last for a fair amount of time and be devoid of any other noises.

**2\. Avoid Copy Pasting Tiny Noise Section in Your Spoken Phrases**

When you have a tiny part of noise between your stated words on your audio, please don't copy/paste it to make a more significant piece of sound for Audacity to examine.

You would not be supplying Audacity with any more information that will help it generate a decent noise profile. The noise profile is what enables Audacity to tell the difference between speech and noise.

**3\. Minimum 2048 Data Samples Required**

To build a noise profile, the Noise Reduction function requires a minimum of 2048 sample data. An audio file with a sampling frequency of 44.1kHz is roughly five hundredths of a second.

Note that this is the minor sound level that Audacity needs to generate a noise profile; however, should you supply a larger sample of the noise, Audacity can typically perform a great job of producing a suitable noise profile. As a result, attempt to capture a few seconds of background noises wherever possible.

**4\. Establish Recording Level and Record "Silence"**

Setting your audio volume and capturing some "quiet" prior to speaking is the best way to achieve this. Instead, when you've finished talking, keep your camera/recorder going for a few moments.

Don't move or create any sounds while capturing the background noises, and keep an ear open for any other noises. You only need to capture the ambient noise for a few moments; two to five seconds will suffice.

## Part 2: How to Remove Background Noise in Audacity on Windows and Mac?

Whether you are using Windows or macOS, we will show you a step-by-step process to achieve your results using both software in this part of Audacity remove background music guide.

**Remove background noise in Audacity on Windows**

**Step 1**: On your recording, select a few moments of sound. Any segment of noise that incorporates other noises should be avoided.

![Audacity remove bg noise](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-audio-clip-without-background-noise.jpg)

**Step 2**: From the **Effect** menu, select **Noise Reduction.**

![Audacity remove noise option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-effect-noise-reduction-option.jpg)

**Step 3**: Select the **Get Noise Profile** option whenever the **Noise Reduction** effect screen appears.

![Audacity get noise profile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audacity-get-noise-profile-option.jpg)

**Note:** Choose whether to implement the noise removal to the entire waveforms or only a portion of it.

**Step 4**: To access the **Noise Reduction** effects window, go to **Effects > Noise Reduction.** Raise the level of noise reduction progressively while previewing the result.

![Audacity noise reduction level](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-noise-reduction-level-audacity.jpg)
