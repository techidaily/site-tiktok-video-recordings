Are you keen on starting your own TikTok journey? There is no two way about the fact that this app is the new kid in town. It is highly popular among the younger generation.

If you are a new TikToker, you need an introduction video. This has to be engaging enough to attract more and more followers. The primary aim of an introduction video is to say high to your followers and tell them about yourself. With this video, they will get to know you better.

## Section 1. Make an Intro Video on TikTok (iPhone)

In case you are all set to create a Tiktok intro video, here are a few tips you need to follow.

• Including Audio

At the top of the screen, you will find the option ‘Sound’. This is where you can look through the music. When you are done choosing the song, decide where you would like it to start and play it when you record to sync the shots better. You can also add sound effects and voice-over.

At present, you can add one song per video inside the app. However, you always have the option to edit the videos using other apps to upload on TikTok.

In TikTok, you can work with multiple audio layers. For example, you have recorded the clip with in-camera audio, sound effect, music, and anything else you have added. The app will let you lower the camera’s audio volume while raising the music volume.

• Working with the Text

For adding title or text to the video, you have to use the Text button. This lets you choose the color, font, and size of the words. If you have used Instagram fonts, this will appear similar. Once you enter the words, choose where you would like to apply them on the screen. You can also set the time and length of the text appearing on the screen.

• Adding Effects

Effects are one of the special aspects of TikTok. There are two ways to use them, before or after recording. When you’re done recording the video, you can reverse it, speed it up, or add filters. The app also lets you apply an effect when you are recording.

Since TikTok videos are mostly viewed on smartphones, vertical orientation is the best option. However, horizontal orientation is also allowed on TikTok. **The best aspect ratio will be 9:16 for TikTok videos** so that they can be viewed properly on any smartphone. Last, but not least, **the dimension has to be 1080 x 1920.**

## Section 2. Make a TikTok Intro Video on Mac

In case you are going off the platform, there are many video editor apps that you can use. With the help of the apps, you will be able to make better videos.

Let’s take a look at the top two video editors that will help you to get the best video for Tiktok.

### 1. [Filmora X for Mac](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Part 3: Viral TikTok Photo/Video Trends You Should Know

While this TikTok photo editing hack has been quite popular, the social media platform has given rise to tons of other trends as well. Here are some of these popular TikTok video/photo editing trends that you can explore.

#### 1\. Runaway by Aurora Trend

This is one of the most aesthetically pleasing trends that has been all over TikTok in 2021\. In this, the popular song Runaway by Aurora is played in the background and the inbuilt TikTok filter is used. It will freeze the frame while recording the video and would automatically change the background to make it look appealing.

#### 2\. Fake Window Trend

The Fake Window trend has been on TikTok for a while now and would only need a projector. As the name suggests, you just have to use a projector to display all kinds of images on a wall or a curtain (making it look like a window). Go ahead and unleash your creative ideas for some stunning video projections and post them on TikTok.

#### 3\. Questions I Get Asked… Trend

TikTok keeps hosting tons of popular trends and this one is no such exception. In this, people simply post videos in which they share some peculiar questions that they get asked a lot. The trend became extremely popular, and you would find the experience of other TikTok users quite funny.
