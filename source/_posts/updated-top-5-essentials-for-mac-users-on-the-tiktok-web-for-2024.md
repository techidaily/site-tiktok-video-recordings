Social media language or terminologies are different from the ones you use in your daily communication. Almost all social media sites engage you with different terms like DP, which means display picture. TikTok is no exception and throws you with different acronyms.

PFP is one of the most widely acknowledged and used acronyms on TikTok. So, there is hardly any TikTok user unaware of PFP. Do you know what does PFP actually means? If not, don’t worry!! The following article will explain to you everything about PFP, from its meaning to its use. Let’s get started.

06 [TikTok PFP FAQs](#part6)

## Part 1: What is PFP on TikTok?

PFP corresponds to Profile Picture on TikTok. Unlike other social media platforms, TikTok users use PFPs to denote profile pictures. On the contrary, only PP is used for the profile picture on other mainstream social media sites. Moreover, PFP is used for Picture For Proof on social media sites, except TikTok.

However, when you see PFP on TikTok, your only concern should be your profile picture.

## Part 2: What is the PFP hashtag on TikTok?
