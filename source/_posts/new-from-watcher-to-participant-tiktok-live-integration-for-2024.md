It also has a built-in music library from which you can choose the song of your choice and give your videos life. Other than this, Filmora has such a wide range of filters and effects available that it gives your videos that special professional touch just by a drag and a drop!

 All you have to do to get started is to launch Filmora and select 9:16 ratio to import your videos, this is the perfect ration for mobile videos. You can make simple changes to the video like trimming and rotating it easily. After that, you can add filters and overlays. Just choose the filter or overlay of your choice and drag it down to the video, that simple!

 Other than this you have soundtrack options and audio adjustment features. You can add the soundtrack of your liking by choosing from the built-in music library to whatever part of the video you prefer again with a single drag and drop. There is all kinds of hot new music available from a vast variety of genres. Moreover, you can remove background noise with the audio adjustment feature and even fix the equalizing, pitch, fade in, fade out, and the speed of the soundtrack.

 Besides this, you can add more features to your video for example slow motion, fast forward, playing the video backwards and even split screen! A split screen is an option in which you can play multiple videos at the same time on the same screen which is also one of the features highly professional video makers use.

 There are multiple video formats available once you are done. Preview your video, click export and easily share it with other social media platforms for example twitter. You can even upload it directly on youtube and choose from different formats available for that. You’re not just restricted to that, you can upload your masterpiece on any social media platform you like even Tik Tok! This will make your videos on Tik Tok stand out as by editing on filmora you can use filters and overlays that are not available on Tik Tok and make your videos unique. This is also a very helpful application for bloggers.

 In the fast-paced and dynamic world of social media, Filmora allows those who aren’t professional but just need an easy way to showcase their creativity and talent on TikTok. These are simple to use and have features available which only professionals had access too at first. So if this is what’s stopping you from becoming a video blogger, let yourself go and download these apps today!
