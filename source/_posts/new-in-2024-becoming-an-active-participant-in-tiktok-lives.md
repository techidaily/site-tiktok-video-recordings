This became his signature move and gained so much popularity that he is now one of the leading comedians on Tiktok. He now has 31.8k followers on Tiktok.

## Conclusion

Tiktok is an amazing social networking website that provides its users an opportunity to express themselves in a very creative manner with a lot of ease. The main purpose of Tiktok was to give people a platform for enjoyment in the form of short videos, and that is exactly what it did!
