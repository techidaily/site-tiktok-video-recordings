TikTok Creator Fund payout depends on a range of factors in relation to your profile and the content you create. These factors include views count and their authenticity, number of engagement, the region where the views come from, and total followers compared to likes. Performance on this social media platform is dynamic as it changes naturally. Besides, the daily funding amount can differ depending on the number of videos released on that day. So, the specific amount differs from one person to another.

Now that you have an idea of the creator fund payout, you might be wondering about top TikTok creators who have monetized their content. Here’s a list of TikTok’s 5 highest paid TikTokers based on Forbes’ list of the highest-earning stars in 2020:
