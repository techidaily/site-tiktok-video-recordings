#### Conclusion

Tik Tok dance challenges have been going viral for a long time now because they are creative and amusing. They can be made much more entertaining by using different video effects.

The most mesmerizing effects can be added through the motion tracking function. It allows you to add objects and animations to your videos and make them extremely befuddling and stimulates one’s imagination.

Motion tracking not only adds objects but also helps stabilize the video. It also lets you add 3d objects in 2d footage and apply other effects and color grading techniques.

Apart from all that it will let you replace screens on different devices such as tablets, computers, and TV devices.

All of this can be achieved with just one top of the line video editing software that is Wondershare’s FilmoraX. So, start your challenges today with the tips and tricks provided and go viral, be famous.
