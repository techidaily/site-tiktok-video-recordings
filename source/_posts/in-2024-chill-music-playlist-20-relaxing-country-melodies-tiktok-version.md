## Part 1: How to Screen Record on TikTok?

Have you ever accidentally taken a screenshot of someone's Instagram story or screen recorded it for future reference and got scared that the person may have got notified?

While Instagram had the feature of notifying users if their story or picture has been screen recorded, it has recently changed to restrict this notification to images and videos sent via private DMs.

However, TikTokers can rest assured as TikTok has never had a similar notification feature, and you can safely screen record TikTok without mentioning the publisher.

**Record Voiceover and Add it to Video**

We suggest you record the voiceover first in most cases so the sound will become pretty natural.

**Step 1: Connect Microphone to PC or laptop**

Connect the microphone to your laptop/PC when you're ready to begin. It's advisable to use some professional external microphones to capture high-quality sound.

**Step 2: Record voiceover**

Tap the **Wondershare Filmora** icon to launch this software. Then, select the New **Project** option in the beginning interface to create a new one.

Enter the **Record** tab and choose the "**Record a Voiceover”** option to arouse the **Record Audio** windows.

Or hit the **microphone** icon, and you only need 3 seconds of countdown to begin speaking.

Click the microphone icon again after you finish the above. Then, a new **Record** file option will be automatically present on the audio track.

**Step 3: Edit Recorded Voiceover to Video**

To edit the recorded voiceover, you can adjust audio settings, such as changing the Speed, Pitch, Volume, etc.

![edit voiceover filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/audio-editing-panel.jpg)

You can cut and trim out unnecessary sound sections from the recorded voiceover or apply the fade effects to the voiceover for a smoother transition.

**Step 4: Sync Voiceover to Video**

Now, it’s time to synchronize the recorded voiceover to video to create a compelling video.

The Wondershare Filmora allows up to 100 audio tracks; you can also add some background music to the voiceover.

Then import and drag-n-drop the video content to the video track, drag and drop the soundtrack to the video's right-side position. Keep the voice and video track in the exact video duration if required.

**Here’s how to sync voiceover to video!**

Now, sync the recorded voiceover to Video to create a video. Since Filmora is compatible with 100 plus audio tracks, you can add different background music to the voiceover.

Then import and drag-n-drop the video content to the video track, drag and drop the soundtrack to the Video's right side position. You can keep the Video and audio track in the same video duration.

![sync voiceover filmora](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/sync-recorded-voiceover-to-video.jpg)

**Note**: If you've recorded the iPhone voiceover or other device already, you can import it in the Project Library if you wish to add it to the Video and then sync it to Video.

Here is the ultimate step-by-step guide about adding titles to videos after knowing **how to do a voiceover on TikTok**.

**Step 5: Export and save the new file**

Click the "**Export**" tab to export your new video file after you complete the project. You can either save the Video to different formats or directly share it on other social media platforms.

Additionally, you can even burn a DVD in minutes to watch it on TV.

**How to Record and Add Voice over File during Filmora's Video Editing Process**

If you've recorded the voice over on your iPhone or another device already, even via the Wondershare Filmora, and wish to add it to the Video, visit the steps mentioned below:

**1\. Upload the video to Filmora**

After logging in to Filmora’s main editing interface, click "Import" or drag-drop your video and voiceover file to the project library.

Filmora video editing software is compatible with a vast range of formats, so there will be no need to convert the files before import.

Drag and drop the files or video content to the Video Timeline when all the files get imported.

**2\. Record Voiceover in Video Editing**

**3\. Edit voiceover and Export**

You can then edit the recorded voiceover for TikTok to perfectly fit the Video and export it to your laptop/PC or directly upload it to YouTube.
