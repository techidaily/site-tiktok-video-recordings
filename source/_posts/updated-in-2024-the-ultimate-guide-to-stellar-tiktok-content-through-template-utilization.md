## The Ultimate Guide to Stellar TikTok Content Through Template Utilization

TikTok is the video platform that shook the world during the pandemic. It capitalized on people's shortened attention spans and focused on short-form videos to provide entertainment. Also, it provided people with an easy road to fame and with a solid side hustle.

Are you one of those who aspire to be TikTok's future top-earner? Try making videos using **TikTok video templates**! They'll allow you to churn out high-quality content faster than the competition. In this article, you will learn more about TikTok videos. Furthermore, we'll introduce you to the 5 best places from where you can find great TikTok video templates.

Get a Knowledge of TikTok Videos

TikTok videos are short-form content. They can be up to 3 minutes in length. And that is their charm. Busy people looking for "bite-sized" content turn to this platform for entertainment.

The TikTok videos that become successful include filters, effects, stickers, voiceovers, and background music. They can be about different topics, so anyone can make them.

An important thing creators should know is the dimension of videos. TikTok videos are made for mobile viewing (though you can watch them using the web app). So, videos are in portrait. That said, the recommended video size is 1080 x 1920 with a 9:16 aspect ratio.

## Why Use Templates To Make TikTok Videos?

The competition on TikTok is tough. A content creator can publish multiple videos in one day because they're short, as long as they have ideas. So, attracting views with your videos is challenging.

If you can't keep up with how fast-paced other content creators are, you should ensure your videos are of high quality. But what if you run out of ideas?

That is where TikTok video templates come in. They are ready-to-use assets you can edit and personalize to make original videos quickly. By using templates, you can stand toe-to-toe with other content creators on the platform.

The best thing is that Pexels does not require attribution - though it encourages giving them. Furthermore, Pexels allow you to edit the media you get from the site. You would not get into legal trouble unless you did something they do not allow, like making identifiable people appear in a bad light.

The catch is that Pexels is only a website where you can find and download stock resources. It does not provide you with any editing tools. Therefore, it's only a good choice if you already have a trusty editor. Or use it in combination with the other options here.
