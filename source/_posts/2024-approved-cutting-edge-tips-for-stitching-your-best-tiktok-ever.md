Built-in voice effects in TikTok include chipmunk, baritone, mike, megaphone, robot, battery drain, shaking, electronic, echo, synth, elf, huge, and acoustic signals.

## Part 2: How to Record and Add Voice TikTok?

Your video must feature your voice to apply Voice Effects. You can't utilize Voice Effects in films created with built-in themes, including audio, for example.

**Step 1:** To begin recording your clip, launch TikTok and hit the **\+ (plus symbol)** at the base.

**Step 2:** Press the **Record** button, record your video as usual, and tap it again to stop or end the recording. Once you're done recording, tick the **Checkmark.**

**Step 3:** Select **Voice Effects** from the drop-down menu on the upper right.

**Step 4:** Tap to hear every one of the effects as the window opens up from the bottom. When you wish to utilize one, pick it and move your finger away from the screen. Tap **None** on the far left when you don't want to employ an voice effect.

**Step 5:** After that, you may add any extra effects to your movie, such as text stickers. When you're finished, tap **Next**. Proceed to choose your Post choices, save the video, or touch **Post** as you would with any other video you've made.

**Step 3:** After recording, now press on the **Checkmark** to save the sample.
