It provides a real and lifelike match with other super influencers on the platform. When used correctly, these tools can help an account become an influencer and make loads of money with the right marketing strategy.

The FeedPixel suggests four types of influencers based on their experience. These four kinds are namely the Nano-influencers, Micro-influencers, Macro-influencers, and Mid-tier influencers. And, another procedure of earning is almost the same as mentioned by other platforms. There is no such difference except the particular strategy and niche you choose for marketing purposes. The most earning influencers are Macro ones with a tremendous rate of commissions. On the other hand, rising Tik Tok influencers can make around $30 to $150 per sponsored content.

**Pros**

* Simple to use
* Free Services
* Applicable on most social media accounts
