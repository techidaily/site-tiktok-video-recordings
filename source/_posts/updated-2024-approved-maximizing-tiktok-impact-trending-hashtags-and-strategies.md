## Part 3: How to Use TikTok Trending Hashtags Effectively?

Using hashtags for TikTok can be a little tricky. So, here are some tips that will help in getting the optimum results.

### Find Relevant Hashtags

When you browse content from your competitor, check out the hashtags they are using for their viral or popular posts. In case it seems like a hectic process, you can take the help of a hashtag generator tool for finding the right hashtags to use for your content.

### Combine Popular Hashtags on TikTok with the Less Popular Ones

One of the primary benefits of using hashtags is that many people search for them. However, there is fierce competition when it comes to popular hashtags. So, you are more likely to get noticed in a narrower niche when you use less competitive and smaller hashtags.

![combine trending tiktok hashtags](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/combine-popular-tiktok-hashtags.png)

Once you start becoming popular with smaller hashtags, you are likely to climb up the larger hashtag feed. This is the reason you should mix both types of hashtags.

### Follow Trends and Use Current Hashtag

So, you are using a hashtag in December and ‘#merrychristmas’ is a popular hashtag to use. However, there is no point in using the same hashtag in February. Hashtag trends keep rising and falling but it is necessary to ensure that the hashtags you are using your content is current.

### Go for Branded Hashtags

When you create your own branded hashtags, it will help your followers find you. In fact, you can reach out to more users with your branded hashtags on this social media platform in comparison to the other social media platforms.

![branded tiktok hashtags](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/branded-tiktok-hashtags.jpg)

As a matter of fact, if you want, you can come up with your own hashtag challenge. You can challenge your users to develop content and then tag them using your branded hashtag. These challenges work exceptionally well on TikTok as they can get users to inspire each other to develop content.

### The More the Better

Using just one hashtag is not going to help. Every hashtag you use is going to expose you to a different set of audiences. So, use as many hashtags as possible.

TikTok places a limitation of 100 characters. This implies you have to keep the hashtags shorts and simple to fit as many as you can.

Some users tend to use the #hashtag in their comments when they run out of the character limit for the caption. These hashtags might work but they aren’t as effective as the ones you include in the caption. So, make sure that you are adding the important hashtags to the captions.

When you use your **top TikTok hashtags** strategically, you can make the most of the content.

## Part 4: Bonus Tip- Use Powerful Video Editor to Create TikTok Videos

At times, even the most popular TikTok hashtags don’t work. This might be due to the poor quality of the video. In that case, you can use a powerful video creator and editor to create your videos. One such effective video creator is Filmora. With this video editing tool, you can apply motion elements, transitions, filters, and a lot more.

The biggest virtual library of entertaining videos, TikTok, now lets you **save TikTok videos to your gallery**. But why bother saving when you can watch it online? Let me ask you another one: do you ever find a music clip that relates to your mood or a funny prank to scare your friends? But what if your friends and family aren't on TikTok? Luckily, you can save TikTok videos and re-share them on other apps like Facebook and Instagram.

You can even save TikTok videos for customization with a video editor. After all, your videos need to be unique to win the race. If you are self-obsessed with your created content, you better save it for safekeeping or to show your kids how cool you used to be. Better safe than sorry, right?

If you are wondering how to save the TikTok video to your gallery, look no further. Here are the three widely used methods for saving TikTok videos.

* [**Method 1: Save TikTok Video by the TikTok App Itself**](#part1)
* [**Method 2: Save TikTok Video Online**](#part2)
* [**Method 3: Save TikTok Video by a Third-Party App**](#part3)
* [**Bonus Tip-Make a TikTok Video Using Wondershare Filmora**](#part4)

## Method 1: Save TikTok Video by the TikTok App Itself

Unlike other apps, TikTok is well aware of our wants and likes. Since we youngsters are the obsessive kind, we love to rewatch our favorite videos countless times until we get bored or move on to the next. Hence TikTok has an in-built option to save TikTok videos to any device, be it a Smartphone or a PC. Better yet, you don't even need to own a TikTok account to save videos. Just install the app and follow these steps. Easy peasy.

1\. Once installed, launch TikTok.

2\. Press the arrow icon('share to' button) on the bottom right.

![find and search your favorite video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-find-and-search-favorite-video.jpg)

3\. Tap on 'Save Video'.

![press video arrow button](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-press-video-arrow-button.jpg)

4\. Voila! Your video will be downloaded to your device within seconds.

![save video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-save-tiktok-video.jpg)

Tips:

TikTok also lets you instantly share the video on Facebook, Instagram, or Whatsapp with a single click

TikTok's hassle-free option will save you a lot of time. You can keep on scrolling and clicking saves to download loads of videos without having to switch from app to app. And it's easier than it sounds—time to quench your video thirst.

## Method 2: Save TikTok Video Online

TikTok downloader, a.k.a TTDownloader is an online tool to help you save your favorite videos from the wonderful library of TikTok. But why use an online tool? Because of the following advantages, it offers:

* Save TikTok video to any device like PC, android, iOS, or tablet.
* Save it in any format, MP3, or MP4.
* Choose to remove the watermark.
* There's no need to download the app. Only the video's URL is needed.
* No registration or installation of the downloader is needed.
* The platform offers free and unlimited downloads.

I'm sure this is enough to convince you but wait till you see how easy it is to use. Follow these steps and see for yourself what the fuss is all about. Here you go:

1\. Open 'www.ttdownloader.com' in the browser.

![open online video downloader](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-open-online-tiktok-downloader.jpg)

2\. Right-click on the TikTok video and tap 'Copy link address.'

![copy video link ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-copy-tiktok-video-link.jpg)

3\. Paste the URL into the textbox on TTDownloader. And hit 'Get Video.' A drop-down menu will appear with different options.

![try to download video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/try-to-download-video.jpg)

4\. Choose the way you want to download your video and click on the 'Download video.' The video will be saved to your gallery within seconds. Easy peasy.

## Method 3: Save TikTok Video by a Third-Party App

TikMate is a TikTok video downloading app available on the Google store. It offers super-fast downloading and is free. You can download unlimited videos, and it doesn't even require logging in. I know that can be tiring and instantly makes you hate the app. With that settled, let me add that it is not just a downloader, but also a video player! How cool. And all the downloaded videos are in the app, so you don't have to search your gallery looking for it.

Some apps have complicated interfaces, but TikMate once again wins us over with its simplicity. Only a few quick steps, and you'll have your favorite video saved.

1\. Download TikMate from the Google store and launch it.

![video app download](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/video-app-download.jpg)

2\. Open TikTok and tap the video you wish to save. Now you can click 'Share,' swipe left, and click 'Others,' and select to open the video with TikMate.

![click share video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/7-click-share-video.jpg)

**Note:** You can also click 'Share', then hit 'Copy link', and open Tikmate to paste the link.

3\. Paste the copied URL OR if it appears automatically after direct sharing to TikMate, click 'Download'.

![click download video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/8-click-download-tiktok-video.jpg)

4\. The video will start downloading and will end up in your gallery as well as in the TikMate library.
