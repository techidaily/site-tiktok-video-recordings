## Part 2: Best 20 TikTok Caption Ideas of 2022

Coming up with a good Tiktok video may be challenging because it is not about getting into a lovely place and beginning to shoot some videos. Yes, you might have all the resources but lack a good caption. Make your video the best by being creative. Aesthetic usernames for TikTok, complemented with a caption, will boost your views. A caption will determine whether your video gets viewed by many people or a few people. Therefore, consider investing time in creating a nice one that will market your video out there. If you don't have spare time for all that, here are some of the best captions you can use.

### Funny Captions

1\. “Getting the best house for your content.”

2\. "Best dancing moves are never created unless they check out mine."

3\. "It's the dancing captain on the move."

4\. "Here's why Dunkin Donuts is going to give me his hand."

5\. "Already famous on TikTok? This is how I made it."

### Cute captions

1\. “No one can challenge me unless I accept defeat.”

2\. “Do this to find love on TikTok.”

3\. “No dancing, no life.”

4\. “I’m the one to receive the audio reward.”

5\. “A true friend must include you on Tiktok.”

### Quote Captions

1\. "Dance is the hidden soul's language" - Martha Graham

2\. “The job of feet is walking, but their hobby is dancing.”- Amit Kalantri

3\. "Dancing is a perpendicular horizontal desire." - George Bernard Shaw

4\. "Those who were observed dancing were said to be insane by those who could not feel the music" - Friedrich Nietzsche

5\. "Every day offers an opportunity for you to draw in a breath. Kick-off your shoes. And dance." - Oprah Winfrey.

### Specifically, for slay queens (isn't it ironic?)

1\. A hardworking daddy who never ceases to provide for the family

2\. I’m just kidding to see your response

3\. I can’t stop enjoying life

4\. Whoever knows the secret of money will stop looking for it.

5\. I think I’m the best of the best.
