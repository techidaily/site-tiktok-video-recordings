There can be several reasons behind why you don't have voice effects on TikTok presently. One of the foremost is that you have old software in either your iPhone or Android. Other reasons include giving the modification permission to TikTok, not clearing cache, updating TikTok, etc.

**2\. How Many Voice Effects in TikTok?**

There are 13 voice effects that you can try in TikTok. These include a chipmunk, baritone, mike, megaphone, robot, battery drain, shaking, electronic, echo, synth, elf, huge, and acoustic signals. Hence, TikTok offers an endless and diverse range of effects

**Conclusion**

Overall, **how to Change on TikTok** is a simple process. For the required minor modifications, we believe the app's built-in editor is sufficient. Filmora, on the other hand, is ideal if you would like to go professional and do unique transitions and edits. We believe we've provided some necessary knowledge on the TikTok application's voice change. We hope you can include fantastic audio effects into your next TikTok video to make it engaging.
