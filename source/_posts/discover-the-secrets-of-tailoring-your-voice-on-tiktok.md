## Part 1: What is Voice Effect?

Picture filters are widely used on Instagram and Snapchat, and we are all acquainted with them. Such filters enable us to add a subtle color change or any other type of modification to our filters. However, because TikTok is all about audio and video, you may utilize voice filters in your videos.

Speech filters are sound effects that enable us to alter our voices. It's worth noting that users can only use the application to apply speech filters to their recorded voice. When you're not using or uploading any recordings, you won't utilize any voice effects.

Built-in voice effects in TikTok include chipmunk, baritone, mike, megaphone, robot, battery drain, shaking, electronic, echo, synth, elf, huge, and acoustic signals.

## Part 2: How to Record and Add Voice TikTok?

Your video must feature your voice to apply Voice Effects. You can't utilize Voice Effects in films created with built-in themes, including audio, for example.

**Step 1:** To begin recording your clip, launch TikTok and hit the **\+ (plus symbol)** at the base.

**Step 2:** Press the **Record** button, record your video as usual, and tap it again to stop or end the recording. Once you're done recording, tick the **Checkmark.**

**Step 3:** Select **Voice Effects** from the drop-down menu on the upper right.

**Step 5:** After that, you may add any extra effects to your movie, such as text stickers. When you're finished, tap **Next**. Proceed to choose your Post choices, save the video, or touch **Post** as you would with any other video you've made.

## Legitimacy in the Limelight: Copyright Verification Before Upload

So, you have successfully created an awesome TikTok video with the perfect dance moves and accurate lip-sync. But what’s this? Your video gets muted or taken down! What a bummer!

The reason?

Copyright infringement, or in simple words, using music without the permission of the singer!

This includes external sounds that are not a part of the TikTok library.

So, what should we do to avoid this, you ask?

To avoid this, you need to learn how to check TikTok video copyright before uploading.

And, in this article, we will tell you exactly why you need to follow TikTok copyright, and how to check it before posting a video.

## **Why Do You Need to Follow Tiktok Copyright?**

To avoid getting banned!

You see, TikTok has a vast library of sounds with proper legal authorization that is available for the users to use in their videos. However, sometimes people use their own music in the videos.

The external sound may or may not be copyrighted.

If it does not have any copyrights on it, all is good. But in case you accidentally use a copyrighted video, TikTok automatically detects it, and either mutes your video or takes it down entirely. If the copyright is detected while posting, the platform will prevent you from uploading it in the first place.

To be on the safe side, we recommend using sounds already present in the TikTok library.

But, what if you want to use an external sound? Is there a way to check TikTok video copyright before uploading?

Yes, there is! And in the next section, we will tell you all about it.

## **Conclusion**

While making TikTok videos is quite a fun activity, we have to follow the rules, especially those revolving around using copyrighted material. According to TikTok’s policies, if a video has copyrighted sound, it will be muted, and if the video itself is copyrighted, like a clip from a movie or song, it will be taken down.

However, if you continue posting copyrighted content even after receiving copyright infringement notices from TikTok, it can result in your getting shut down for good!

Therefore, it’s good to know how to check TikTok video copyright before uploading through the steps explained in the article.

So, run a copyright check, and play it safe!

## **Conclusion**

While making TikTok videos is quite a fun activity, we have to follow the rules, especially those revolving around using copyrighted material. According to TikTok’s policies, if a video has copyrighted sound, it will be muted, and if the video itself is copyrighted, like a clip from a movie or song, it will be taken down.

However, if you continue posting copyrighted content even after receiving copyright infringement notices from TikTok, it can result in your getting shut down for good!

Therefore, it’s good to know how to check TikTok video copyright before uploading through the steps explained in the article.

So, run a copyright check, and play it safe!

## **Check Tiktok Video Copyright Before Uploading**

Whenever you’re posting a video to TikTok, you get the option of running a copyright check on it. But this option is only available on desktop browsers.

Therefore, if you’re posting a sound other than one from TikTok’s library, you can check if it’s copyrighted or not from your PC.

Here’s how:

**Step 1**

Go to the website version of [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/) from Chrome, and click on “Log In” at the top-right corner of the page. You can also click on “Log In” under the “Following” option on the left.
