If you are facing some other kind of problem then you can always directly contact the support team at TikTok.

02 [Why Are TikTokers Changing Their Profile Picture?](#part2)

03 [Creative TikTok PFP Ideas to Make Your Profile Attractive](#part3)

04 [How to Customize PFP on TikTok?](#part4)

## Part 1: What Does PFP for TikTok Mean?

PFP is an acronym for Profile Picture. It is an obvious one. Previously, profile picture was simply known as PP but TikTok users use the acronym PFP. On other social media platforms, the acronym stands for Picture for Proof. Thus, it basically is asking a user to send proof of what they are doing.
