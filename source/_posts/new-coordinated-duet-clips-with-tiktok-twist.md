### Quick Fix: Why can’t I make a duet video or how to prevent people from creating duet videos with me?

There are chances that you will not be able to create duet videos with some people. It happens just because those people have prevented others from creating duet videos with them. Although there is no method to delete the duet videos that others have created with you, yes, you can prevent it in the future by using app settings. By doing this, you are keeping your profile publicly visible, but you are not allowing other people to create a duet with you. If you want to do such settings; go through the steps below.

### How to prevent people from creating duet videos with you?

Step 1: First of all, open the app and then go to privacy settings.

Step 2: Now move to the Safety option.

Step 3: Click on the option “Who Can Duet With Me.” Now you can choose the suitable option out of “Everyone,” “Friends” or simply “Off.” The last option doesn’t allow anyone to make duet videos with you; however, the second one allows only mutual followers to create videos with you.

## Special Effects That Can Make Your Tiktok Dance Routine Special

Tik Tok comes with various options of different effects on its own. Whenever you make a video on Tik Tok, you can easily add effects from the app after you are done recording. Nevertheless, there is always a limit to the number of effects offered by the app.

For that execution, you will need an external video editing app to edit your videos. [Wondershare’s FilmoraX](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is recommended to be the best video editing software used for these purposes.
