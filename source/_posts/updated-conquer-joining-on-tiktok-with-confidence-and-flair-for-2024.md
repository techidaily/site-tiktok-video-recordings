PFP is an acronym for Profile Picture. It is an obvious one. Previously, profile picture was simply known as PP but TikTok users use the acronym PFP. On other social media platforms, the acronym stands for Picture for Proof. Thus, it basically is asking a user to send proof of what they are doing.

1. Whenever there is a change in their appearance or style, such as weight loss, haircut, or some cosmetic enhancements.
2. When they are actively searching for more followers.

### 2\. Aesthetic PFP for TikTok

Aesthetic PFP is the subject that is being searched for by the user. It should tell your followers what the profile is about. In this case, you have to decide between a brand logo and a personal photo. For instance, if it is a page on food, get an attractive photo of any food item shot. Make sure that the focus of the photo is centered. It should be as large as possible.
