## Part 3: Why You Shouldn't Remove the Watermark from TikTok Videos?

People have divided opinions when it comes to keeping the watermark logo or getting rid of it entirely. Understandably, the TikTok emblem can be bothersome to specific users because it seems an "extra" item on the screen rather than a part of the content.

## Part 3: Why You Shouldn't Remove the Watermark from TikTok Videos?

People have divided opinions when it comes to keeping the watermark logo or getting rid of it entirely. Understandably, the TikTok emblem can be bothersome to specific users because it seems an "extra" item on the screen rather than a part of the content.

Yet, this does not imply that we support or urge its removal. If you're seeking to promote your content across many channels, you must retain the watermark since it allows the creator of the content to be correctly recognized.

## Part 1: What Does PFP for TikTok Mean?

PFP is an acronym for Profile Picture. It is an obvious one. Previously, profile picture was simply known as PP but TikTok users use the acronym PFP. On other social media platforms, the acronym stands for Picture for Proof. Thus, it basically is asking a user to send proof of what they are doing. Nonetheless, they are primarily associated with IM and Snapchat apps.

As TikTok is a video-sharing platform, PFP just stands for the profile picture.

## Part 2: Why Are TikTokers Changing Their Profile Picture?

Your profile picture says a lot about you. So, you should be on top of your game when it comes to the image you are portraying to the world. There are many reasons for TikTokers to change their profile picture. However, one of the primary reasons is to get noticed.

Let’s check out the reasons why they keep changing their profile picture.

1. Whenever there is a change in their appearance or style, such as weight loss, haircut, or some cosmetic enhancements.
2. When they are actively searching for more followers.
3. If some significant event has taken place in their life.
4. When they are just tired of seeing the same picture.
5. When the profile picture isn’t representing you anymore.

## Part 3: Creative TikTok PFP Ideas to Make Your Profile Attractive

So, you want your profile to grab more followers. One way to do that is to use the best PFP for TikTok. Here are some ideas that can help you out.

### 1\. Cute PFP for TikTok

Using a cute PFP can be a great idea. But a cute DP on social media platforms has become highly conventional. Yes, you can use your own photos but it is better to have a cute-looking baby’s face. You can also choose to use an Asian girl or an anime girl. Remember, cute profile pictures aren’t just about smiling or posing beautifully in front of the camera. You need to take care of the aesthetic PFP for TikTok. So, make sure it has proper framing and a good backdrop.

### 2\. Aesthetic PFP for TikTok

Aesthetic PFP is the subject that is being searched for by the user. It should tell your followers what the profile is about. In this case, you have to decide between a brand logo and a personal photo. For instance, if it is a page on food, get an attractive photo of any food item shot. Make sure that the focus of the photo is centered. It should be as large as possible.

### 3\. Funny PFP for TikTok

TikTok is a social media platform for relaxing. It entertains you. This is the reason many TikTok users share funny content. In case you are one such user, you should use a Funny profile picture. A funny picture is going to bring a smile to the face of the viewers. You can use some pictures from the internet if you don’t want to use your own picture.

### 4\. Anime Profile Picture

Anime photos are great for TikTok. In fact, they are popular among all social media platforms. Fans tend to go gaga over these popular characters and thus, they use them for their profile. So, it can be an excellent choice as your PFP. By adding this as your profile picture, you can connect with other accounts that share the same interest.

Cartoon PFPs are highly popular on TikTok. Users find any cartoon character that they enjoy or relate to and will use it as an image of that character. So, you can use the same for your account.

## Part 4: How to Customize PFP on TikTok?

Make sure that you are adjusting the elements properly.
3. You can check the result by clicking on the Play option present in the Preview window. In case you are happy with the outcome, you can move on to the next step.
4. When you are done editing the picture, you have to click on the ‘Export’ button for the output. Since you will only be able to upload your PFP through your Android or iOS smartphone, you have to choose a device present on the Export Window’s left panel and then select the device.

However, you should know that exporting is not going to transfer your photo to your TikTok account. You will have to add your newly customized photo to your profile from your mobile device.
