Adding Tags sounds simple. However, it gives unprecedented results for your TikTok account and posted videos. What you need to do is, at the end of the post (or in the middle also), you need to put some valuable hashtags (the symbol "# followed by a short text without space"), which tells about your video genre. So, whenever any user clicks on the particular hashtags, those users will directly be able to see your video content, media file, or will get directed to your content area. Thus, giving your post a boost. Hence this is how to get views on TikTok.

#### Tip 2: Actively involved: At least one post per day

You must be aware of the idea of activeness. Whoever remains active wins the race. The fact behind is, if you actively engage in posting the content over your TikTok account, then the users will feel the sense of connection, and the chain reaction will increase the size of followers day by day.

Further, be consistent in posting at least one post per day. It will reflect your keen interest in the TikTok profile.

#### Tip 3: ‘For You’ page

Another valuable trick is to involve/include the front page, 'For You' page for the users.

So, when any user lands on your page, they will get the content of interest, enhancing their chances of revisiting your profile. Also, you will get an idea of what is the most liked video on TikTok.

#### Tip 4: Collaborate with your friends
