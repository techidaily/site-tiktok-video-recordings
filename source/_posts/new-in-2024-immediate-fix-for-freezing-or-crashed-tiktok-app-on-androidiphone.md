### 5\. Reset the Network

TikTok has become a very frequently used app globally, however occasionally its users have to confront certain challenges. Sometimes when viewing or recording a video, an error does not allow the app to play the video. This issue is not directly connected to the app; however, we may solve this mistake by utilizing alternative ways such as network difficulties.

* Open the settings and click on the network and internet option. From there, click on the mobile network > Open ‘Advanced Options’

* Click on the access point names and select the three full stops in the upper right corner of your phone's screen.

## Part 4: Conclusion

Sometimes all that TikTok needs is an update.

If you are on an Android smartphone, go to the Play Store, search for TikTok, and check if there is an update available.

Part 2\. Types of TikTok Bugs Leads to TikTok Not Working

On TikTok’s side, the TikTok issues might be caused by glitches or flaws in the software. There may also be an issue with TikTok’s server resulting in TikTok problems. Regular updates generally solve issues on the TikTok app. Some mistakes are more prevalent than others. While others emerge relatively infrequently. Although, the more familiar the issue, the more readily it may be rectified. However, for unusual TikTok issues, you need to become more technical or obtain assistance from official sources like customer support. TikTok faults might come from both your side and from TikTok. Locally, your settings might mix up with the app resulting in TikTok issues. Other applications in your phone might potentially interact with TikTok resulting in multiple TikTok failures.
