Every rising pop star needs music videos, but using professional video editing software may be too time-consuming if you want to quickly create a clone video you can share with your fans on TikTok.

Multiplying yourself in a video is a cool way of making sure that your video is going to get the kind of attention it deserves. The process of [cloning yourself in a video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is a simple one, but there are certain rules you have to follow while recording the footage that will help you avoid overlapping the figures you're cloning. Here's how you can make your first **clone yourself video on TikTok**.

![Clone Yourself on TikTok](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/clone-yourself-on-tiktok.jpg)

## Selecting the Song for your Clone Video

Before you start shooting the video you first need to select the song on [TikTok](https://itunes.apple.com/US/app/id835599320?mt=8)you're going to use in the video. Once you've found the perfect track simply record it and save it as a video to your camera roll. You can then import the video clip that contains the song into the [Video Star](http://videostarapp.com/) app.

Here are [10 Popular TikTok Songs](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for you.

## Using the Video Star App to Clone Yourself

#### 1\. Download Video Star App

Choosing a location, mounting your iPhone on a tripod, or picking the positions for each of your clones are all important steps you'll need to take before you actually start recording. There are several apps that enable you to create clone videos easily, but in this article, we are going to show you how you can clone yourself with Video Star. The app can be downloaded from the App Store for free, but additional in-app purchases are necessary if you want to have access to all the power packs Video Star offers. You don't have to record the video clips with this app since the iPhone's native camera app is powerful enough to enable you to record high-quality footage.

#### 2\. Edit Multiple Video Clips

After you record all the positions for your next clone video with the iPhone's native camera app, you should cut the video clips and keep only the parts where you are perfectly positioned, so your position in one clip doesn't overlap with other positions. During the video recording process try to create as much separation between two positions in order to avoid any chance of overlapping. One of the best ways to achieve this is to shoot at a location that is spacious enough so you can make enough separation between two positions. Keep in mind that the maximum number of clips you can combine in the Video Star app is limited to just three, so if you want to have more than three clones in the shot you first have to piece together three clips, save them as a single file and then add more clips to the cloned video you created.

#### 3\. Level up Your Videos with Video Star

Video Star also enables you to shoot your videos from the app, and you can adjust the Countdown before the app starts recording or the Recording Speed. Make sure to enter the lowest Recording Speed value possible, because that way you'll be recording like TikTok does on fast.

Tap the Record button, then select the Multiple options, and play the video that contains the song you previously selected. Once you reach the spot in the song where you want to introduce the clone simply tap Set, so the recording will stop at the designated point and you can move to another position. If at any point during recording you realize that your movements extend to your clone's location, you can simply tap on the hamburger icon and select the Delete Last option.

To preview the video, you just have to tap on the Scissors icon, and the recorded video will automatically start playing. The Record New Clip in the Scissors menu lets you start from the beginning in case you're not happy with the results or you can use this option to start recording the video with the second position of your clone.

When done, head back to the Scissors menu, and tap on the Multi-Layer Clip. This feature doesn't come with the free version of the app, and you must purchase it in order to create a clone video. This action will enable you to select the back and front clips. After selecting the clips, the Mask Front menu will appear on the screen, choose the Shape option and use the hamburger icon on the right side of the screen to change the video's shape to Rectangle. Drag the rectangle in the preview window so you can crop the first clip to match the demands of your video and press the Next icon to continue the video editing process.

Alternatively, you can use the Erase option to remove the unwanted parts of each video. You can find this option in the Mask Front or Mask Back menu, so just select it and use your finger to remove sections of the shot you don't want to use.

The Add Effect menu will pop up on the screen so you can add different effects to your first video clip, and then repeat the entire process for the back clip. Once you've edited the second clip tap on the Create button to complete the process of making a multilayer clip. Tap Done to save the clip to your camera roll, and upload it to TikTok.

### Conclusion

Cloning yourself in a video using the Video Star app is a simple process that can be mastered in a short period of time. The Video Star app lets you create as many clones of yourself as you want, so you just have to make sure that your video clips can be easily combined to feature two or more of your clones and have fun exploring the effects that can make your videos look even cooler. If you want to be a success on the TikTok platform, learning how to make clone videos is one of the best ways to do it, so choose your favorite songs and start producing clone yourself videos.

## Part 1: What is a Caption on TikTok?

A caption is what you will need to make your videos stand out just by using a few phrases. Of course, you will want your video to be captivating and get more subscribers. A good caption would be short and straightforward, but at the same time, exciting. All you need is to get an excellent caption to promote your entertaining video.

If that still sounds difficult, you can use one of these 20 TikTok captions ideas in one of your videos.

After posting the video, please take a minute and go back to confirm whether you have done it right without forgetting to include an excellent TikTok username. Also, don't forget to go through some of your best videos, like dances or anything you like.

## Part 2: Best 20 TikTok Caption Ideas of 2022

Coming up with a good Tiktok video may be challenging because it is not about getting into a lovely place and beginning to shoot some videos. Yes, you might have all the resources but lack a good caption. Make your video the best by being creative. Aesthetic usernames for TikTok, complemented with a caption, will boost your views. A caption will determine whether your video gets viewed by many people or a few people. Therefore, consider investing time in creating a nice one that will market your video out there. If you don't have spare time for all that, here are some of the best captions you can use.

### Funny Captions

1\. “Getting the best house for your content.”

2\. "Best dancing moves are never created unless they check out mine."

3\. "It's the dancing captain on the move."

4\. "Here's why Dunkin Donuts is going to give me his hand."

5\. "Already famous on TikTok? This is how I made it."

### Cute captions

1\. “No one can challenge me unless I accept defeat.”

2\. “Do this to find love on TikTok.”

3\. “No dancing, no life.”

5\. “A true friend must include you on Tiktok.”

### Quote Captions

4\. "Those who were observed dancing were said to be insane by those who could not feel the music" - Friedrich Nietzsche

5\. "Every day offers an opportunity for you to draw in a breath. Kick-off your shoes. And dance." - Oprah Winfrey.

2\. I’m just kidding to see your response

3\. I can’t stop enjoying life

4\. Whoever knows the secret of money will stop looking for it.

5\. I think I’m the best of the best.

## Part 3: How to Add Texts/Captions to TikTok Videos

A good caption would be short and straightforward, but at the same time, exciting. All you need is to get an excellent caption to promote your entertaining video.

## Part 2: Best 20 TikTok Caption Ideas of 2022

Coming up with a good Tiktok video may be challenging because it is not about getting into a lovely place and beginning to shoot some videos. Yes, you might have all the resources but lack a good caption. Make your video the best by being creative. Aesthetic usernames for TikTok, complemented with a caption, will boost your views. A caption will determine whether your video gets viewed by many people or a few people. Therefore, consider investing time in creating a nice one that will market your video out there. If you don't have spare time for all that, here are some of the best captions you can use.

### Funny Captions

1\. “Getting the best house for your content.”

2\. "Best dancing moves are never created unless they check out mine."

3\. "It's the dancing captain on the move."

4\. "Here's why Dunkin Donuts is going to give me his hand."

5\. "Already famous on TikTok? This is how I made it."

### Cute captions

1\. “No one can challenge me unless I accept defeat.”

2\. “Do this to find love on TikTok.”

3\. “No dancing, no life.”

5\. "Every day offers an opportunity for you to draw in a breath. Kick-off your shoes. And dance." - Oprah Winfrey.

### Specifically, for slay queens (isn't it ironic?)

1\. A hardworking daddy who never ceases to provide for the family

2\. I’m just kidding to see your response

3\. I can’t stop enjoying life

4\. Whoever knows the secret of money will stop looking for it.
