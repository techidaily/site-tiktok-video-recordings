## Quick Fix: Why can’t you go live on Tik Tok?

Some people also complain that they are not able to find Go Live feature on the Tik Tok app. Well! If this is happening with you too; go through these details below:

* Note that, Go Live feature is currently in the testing phase; hence, it is not available to all users. In order to use this feature, it is important to use the latest version of the TikTok app.
* Users these days are restricted to use banned words to their live videos. The list includes BFF, follow, fan, duet, donation and drama queen, etc. It is better to use some alternating words to make your video valuable online.
* In case if you are not able to see the Live Button on the screen; the chances are that your device is doing some audio recording because the Live option disappears during such recordings. There is no need to go to any song rather you have to hit the Plus+ button available on the bottom of the screen, and soon a video button will appear on the screen, besides this button; you will also find the option to Go Live.
* Some rumors say that the Tik Tok app allows only 1k fans to go live at an instant; however, reports say that this count keeps on varying in different countries.

**Conclusion:**

Probably, now you have collected all the essential information about the Go Live feature of the TikTok app. This is another interesting thing to do online but make sure you have an updated version of the app to start creating your own live streams using TikTok. Prefer to use some interesting captions for your live videos so that they can capture more attention online.
