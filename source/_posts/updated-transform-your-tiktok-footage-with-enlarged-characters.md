**Step 9**

Before posting the video on Tiktok, you can add a description, hashtags, and tag friends in it. You can also adjust the settings of who can watch your video, who can comment, and if people can make duets.

Once all the settings have been finalized, click on “Post” to post the video to Tiktok.

![tap on “post” option to upload the video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/25-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)

And that’s how you create, edit, and post a Tiktok video on Android and iOS devices.

## **Conclusion**

Tiktok videos are not only about following the trends; in fact, you can use them to create brand awareness, market your product or services, or engage with your audience in an effective way. However, the key is to make a video worth watching! And while Tiktok’s built-in editor has many tools, it comes with certain limitations.

If you want to make your video more exciting and different from the rest, you can always go for an external video editor, like Wondershare Filmora, and edit videos on your desktop. I hope our steps on how to create successful Tiktok videos on desktop, Android, and iPhone will come in handy and increase your Tiktok followers!

**Step 2**

Launch the tool, and click on the “+” sign to import the Tiktok video you want to edit.

![to import the video for editing, click on the “ + ” sign.](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/2-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)

**Step 3**

Once your video clip is successfully imported to the timeline, it’s time to get editing! Filmora offers many basic and advanced editing tools to give a professional touch to your Tiktok videos.

For example, you can:

* Add audio to your videos from a vast library of tracks for all occasions.

![add “audio” to the video from software’s library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/3-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)

* Add titles and subtitles in different fonts and styles.

![add “titles and subtitles” to the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/4-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)

* Add unique transitions to make your videos enjoyable.

![add “transition” to the video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/5-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)

* Add various audio and visual effects to your videos.

* Add different elements in the video for a thrilling effect.

![add “elements” to the video ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/7-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)

* Split the screen into several different shapes and styles.

![split the screen of the video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/8-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)

Apart from this, you can also add the slo-mo effect and play the video backward for added fun.

**Step 4**

Once you have edited the Tiktok video to your heart’s content, you can preview it to see if any further changes are required. After that, you can export it to your Android or iOS device to upload directly from the Tiktok app.

![export the tiktok video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/9-how-to-create-successful-tiktok-videos-on-desktop-android-iPhone.png)

And that’s how you edit a Tiktok video on a desktop.

Now, if you want to create successful Tiktok videos right from the palm of your hands, here is a tutorial for both Android and iPhone.
