TikTok's hassle-free option will save you a lot of time. You can keep on scrolling and clicking saves to download loads of videos without having to switch from app to app. And it's easier than it sounds—time to quench your video thirst.

## Method 2: Save TikTok Video Online

TikTok downloader, a.k.a TTDownloader is an online tool to help you save your favorite videos from the wonderful library of TikTok. But why use an online tool? Because of the following advantages, it offers:

* Save TikTok video to any device like PC, android, iOS, or tablet.
* Save it in any format, MP3, or MP4.
* Choose to remove the watermark.
* There's no need to download the app. Only the video's URL is needed.
* No registration or installation of the downloader is needed.
* The platform offers free and unlimited downloads.

I'm sure this is enough to convince you but wait till you see how easy it is to use. Follow these steps and see for yourself what the fuss is all about. Here you go:

1\. Open 'www.ttdownloader.com' in the browser.

TikMate is a TikTok video downloading app available on the Google store. It offers super-fast downloading and is free. You can download unlimited videos, and it doesn't even require logging in. I know that can be tiring and instantly makes you hate the app. With that settled, let me add that it is not just a downloader, but also a video player! How cool. And all the downloaded videos are in the app, so you don't have to search your gallery looking for it.

Some apps have complicated interfaces, but TikMate once again wins us over with its simplicity. Only a few quick steps, and you'll have your favorite video saved.

* **Audio Ducking:** Fade or lower the background audio so that the dialogue you want to focus on stands out. Audio ducking introduces a dramatic effect to your video. Using this feature also ensures a professional outlook. The technique might seem sophisticated but is actually a one-click process. Just select the clip you want to audio-focus and click **Adjust Audio**.
* **Keyframing:** Now, you can animate your videos by using pre-sets. If you want to customize your animations, you can do it in just a few taps. Rotate, zoom, or change the position of the video in any way you like.
* **Color Matching:** One of the most important editing features. One-click color match allows you to copy color from one video to another. This feature will give your clips a consistent look. You can even save a color-corrected template for further use.
* **Dark/Light Interface:** It doesn't matter what time of the day (or night) it is. Select the model that suits you.
