**Step 1:**  Launch the TikTok app and then head to your profile by clicking on the **Profile** option at the bottom right. After that, select the three dots to open the **settings**.

**Step 2:** After entering the settings, select **Privacy** to proceed, and then tap on the **Stitch** option to open the Stitch settings.

**Step 3:** Now, you will see three options that are **No-one, Everyone, and Friends.** If you want to allow the Stitching, select either **Everyone** or **Friends.** However, to restrict the people from stitching your videos, choose **No-one.** After you are done selecting, click on the back arrow to save the applied changes.

## Part 3: How to Stitch on TikTok?

TikTok keeps giving creators more reasons to continue producing, and fans like us are more committed to continuing to open it. Stitch, a new app functionality from the famous social networking platform, makes things more straightforward than ever for artists to interact with each other.

But, you might be wondering, how to do a stitch on TikTok? Don't worry; you've come to the right place. Here's how:

**Step 1:** Launch TikTok and then go to the video that you want to stitch. Select the **Share** icon, which resembles an arrow. Select the **Stitch** symbol from the menu that displays, and then wait a few seconds for the video to complete. The lengthier the video is, the more the loading time.

## Part 4: How to Stitch Any TikTok Video with [Filmora Video Editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)?

Before getting started, understand why people opt for Filmora video editor for stitching videos on TikTok when this can be done through the official TikTok application. TikTok app only allows you to stitch a video for up to five seconds which is quite frustrating if you wish to stitch an entire video.

One more reason is that, with TikTok, you cannot stitch the already existing video from the camera roll, which restricts creators from adding the already edited content to the existing video. So, to avoid the above problems, Filmora is used for stitching TikTok videos.

**Step 2:** Drag the clips from the media library to the Timeline's video track. All video files will be stitched into a single video with no transitions.

## Part 5: FAQs About TikTok Video Stitch

**1\. Can you do a Stitch on TikTok with a video from your Camera Roll?**

Unfortunately, you cannot utilize a video from your Camera Roll in a Stitch at the time of this writing. So, whatever your reaction to a Stitch is, you must record 100% unique footage shot with the TikTok camera. However, you may download the video first and then stitch it with some third-party software such as Filmora.

**2\. Can you stitch longer than 5 seconds?**

No, it is not possible to stitch a video for longer than five seconds using the built-in Stitching feature of the TikTok app. But this can be done by stitching the videos using third-party applications and software.

**3\. How do I see TikTok stitches?**

Users who want to view as many stitches as possible can do it by browsing for them on the app. You must first browse to **Discover,** and from there to the search box. Then type **#Stitch @username,** where the **username** is the name of the account from which you wish to view stitches.

**4\. TikTok Stitch option not showing. How to fix it?**

Users may choose whether or not someone else can Stitch their work in their settings. The option may be found under the **Settings** and **Privacy** tab, where users can activate or uncheck Stitch for all videos. So, if the Stitch option is not showing, the user may have disabled the Stitch option.

**Conclusion**
