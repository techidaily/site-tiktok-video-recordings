![tiktok banner office](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/Mac-articles/tiktok-banner-office.jpg)

TikTok allows people to view other clips, make short clips, and introduce several effects. That being said, there are some occasions where you'll have to erase watermarks or unused parts, distort some bits of the video, take a video, and much more. The most fanciful, glamorous, and fascinating your TikTok is, the more viewers will watch them. So if you'd like to draw people to your TikTok content, you'll have to choose some of the TikTok video editing apps/ websites to edit your videos.
