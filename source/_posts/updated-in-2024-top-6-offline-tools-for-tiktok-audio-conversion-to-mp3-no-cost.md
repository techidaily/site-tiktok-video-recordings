## Part 2: How to Convert TikTok Video to MP4 without Watermark?

Before proceeding further, it's essential to consider whether any copyright infringement issues could arise from downloading a TikTok video. According to the Community Guidelines of TikTok, users cannot post, send, or share any content that violates someone else's trademarks, copyrights, or intellectual property rights.

To prevent this, TikTok applies a watermark featuring both its accountâ€™s username and the logo that originally posted the content if someone downloads a TikTok video.

In other words, you have to ensure the watermark's visibility or give full credit to the user in another way while reposting the user's video on social media. And, this is where the job of the best TikTok converter MP4 comes in.

Cropping watermarks from your videos with Wondershare Filmora video editing software is a pretty straightforward process. You don't need be a professional to finish these simple editing actions.

All you must do is choose a method that best suits your preferences and performs an easy action, though.
