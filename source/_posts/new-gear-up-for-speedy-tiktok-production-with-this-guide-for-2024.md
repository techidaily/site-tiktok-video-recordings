## Part 4: How to Create a Stunning Cooking Video?

Here are some tricks to create stunning cooking videos-

* Make sure that you plan ahead. If it is your first time, donâ€™t do it on camera. Practice first before recording.
* It can be tricky to use one camera to record the video from a different camera. Using two cameras will give you a better video.
* You shouldnâ€™t distract the viewers from the cooking video. So, donâ€™t wear something loud or white. Go for solid and bright colors.
* Use Filmoraâ€™s cooking video template to make your video stand out.
