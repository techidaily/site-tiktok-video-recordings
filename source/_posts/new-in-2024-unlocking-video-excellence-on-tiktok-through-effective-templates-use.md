Get a Knowledge of TikTok Videos

TikTok videos are short-form content. They can be up to 3 minutes in length. And that is their charm. Busy people looking for "bite-sized" content turn to this platform for entertainment.

The TikTok videos that become successful include filters, effects, stickers, voiceovers, and background music. They can be about different topics, so anyone can make them.

An important thing creators should know is the dimension of videos. TikTok videos are made for mobile viewing (though you can watch them using the web app). So, videos are in portrait. That said, the recommended video size is 1080 x 1920 with a 9:16 aspect ratio.

That is where TikTok video templates come in. They are ready-to-use assets you can edit and personalize to make original videos quickly. By using templates, you can stand toe-to-toe with other content creators on the platform.

 _“Despite the odds, Tik Tok remains in place and stays favorite for most social media users.”_

Especially in Tier 3 and Tier 4 markets, TikTok forms a strong user base. For the same reason, brands are trying to make their products famous via customer reach in these markets.

You know, the main goal of marketing is to convert visitors into customers. And, you have plenty of platforms to show your marketing skills to reach the target audience. One of the highly influential and growing platforms is TikTok. At the same time, **TikTok influencer** marketing plays an essential role in day-to-day life because billions of people use the app every minute. Just like YouTube, you have to sell your products or brand to indulge in marketing with TikTok influencers. The campaign generally revolves around creating, sharing, and sometimes video lives streaming to let people know about your brand and sell related products.

![TikTok Influencer](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-influencer.jpg)

Recently, Amir Siddiqui, a Tik Tok star, claimed that Tik Tok's short video format is more in use by brands as compared to other platforms like YouTube, Facebook, etc. Brands have significantly made the Chinese app in their list of favorites. Also, in the new COVID-19 global pandemic situation, many high-end influencers are resorting to TikTok as the most cost-effective marketing method.

So, let’s figure out what algorithm works behind influencer marketing TikTok. After analyzing the strategies of expert tik tokers and looking at their interviews, we have devised an ultimate guide on how to become an influencer on TikTok.

## How to be a good TikTok influencer and Stand Out from Peers

No doubt, influencer marketing at TikTok works. But is it easy? Well, not at all due to the increasing competition. Look at the content, and the way users who have millions or billions of followers on TikTok create videos. They put complete effort into making a video. It doesn't come as it is. You have to consider various creative elements to get that video on the platform to convert visitors into customers. Even though Tik tok follows the YouTube creator revenue-sharing model, the brands are more likely to approach TikTok creators than Youtubers. Brand marketers check Tik Tok Creator's Marketplace in terms of followers count, audience demographics, and the form of content.

Given below are three elements you have to consider in TikTok influencer marketing. It will ultimately tell you how to use TikTok for marketing.

* [Part 1: Prepare yourself before shooting TikTok videos](#part1)
* [Part 2: Properly manage TikTok account](#part2)
* [Part 3: Deal with the Feedbacks and Comments from your Fans and Haters](#part3)

### Part 1: Prepare yourself before shooting TikTok videos

First, prepare yourself and then take steps forward if you are looking to make a video that stands out better, among others. You can even access lots of features on the app.

The very first step is to consider your interest. That interest will lead you to make content that stands out from others. However, it is not the only thing you have to keep in mind. There are related factors such as demand, competition, and overall marketing analysis.

Do not forget to keep up with the trend. Whether you are making a highly entertaining or educational informative video, you have to make extra effort to get that real-time engagement. After analyzing your target audience, look up to your position among other Tik Tok creators. If you are a complete beginner, then it may take 2-3 months to get that level only if you are consistent and following all the algorithms applicable in-app.

#### Target Audience

Target audiences are your ultimate customers. Most of the target audience base in Tik Tok comprises of youngsters. So, you have to make a user-friendly content to attract sponsorships and targeted brands. You can target a particular audience by incorporating their interests into the video, such as hashtags, their favorite music, and performing duets.

#### Analyze Tik Tok marketing

Well, most of the marketing analysis portion has to be done by the brands. They have to look for a suitable creator with a good number of followers to advertise their products. And, all of this is possible only when you have a receptive Tik Tok account. So, it's essential to pay attention to various promotion strategies to get those followers, likes, and real-time engagements.

#### Position Basic Tools

To make an attractive video, you will need a laptop or PC, your favorite background music available on TikTok itself, or you can even download music from TikTok. Then, you need a video of your own which you want to sync with the music. And, after having all of these things, consider a versatile video editing tool.
