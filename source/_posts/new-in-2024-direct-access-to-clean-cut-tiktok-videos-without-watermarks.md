## Part 3: Why You Shouldn't Remove the Watermark from TikTok Videos?

People have divided opinions when it comes to keeping the watermark logo or getting rid of it entirely. Understandably, the TikTok emblem can be bothersome to specific users because it seems an "extra" item on the screen rather than a part of the content.
