The newest editing options to make your TikTok videos stand out include:

* **Motion Tracking:** Now, you can add a Hollywood-style effect to your video with the simple motion tracking feature by Filmora. The motion tracking icon is now right above the timeline. Just select an object or person to track and click the icon. As easy as that. Track an athlete on the race track or follow a ship in its journey.
* **Audio Ducking:** Fade or lower the background audio so that the dialogue you want to focus on stands out. Audio ducking introduces a dramatic effect to your video. Using this feature also ensures a professional outlook. The technique might seem sophisticated but is actually a one-click process. Just select the clip you want to audio-focus and click **Adjust Audio**.
* **Keyframing:** Now, you can animate your videos by using pre-sets. If you want to customize your animations, you can do it in just a few taps. Rotate, zoom, or change the position of the video in any way you like.
* **Color Matching:** One of the most important editing features. One-click color match allows you to copy color from one video to another. This feature will give your clips a consistent look. You can even save a color-corrected template for further use.
* **Dark/Light Interface:** It doesn't matter what time of the day (or night) it is. Select the model that suits you.

## Conclusion

There you go. Now you are well aware of how to save TikTok videos to your gallery. Say goodbye to days of worry when you feared losing your favorite videos. They can now rest safe and sound in your gallery to be watched whenever you like. No matter which method you use to save the videos, it will only take a couple of minutes, and bam! Saved.

But if you want to go the extra mile and make an exciting TikTok video with cool effects, Wondershare Filmora is the app that comes to mind. You don't even have to learn to use the app, follow the steps, and the user-friendly interface will help you create a mind-blowing video in no time.

The biggest virtual library of entertaining videos, TikTok, now lets you **save TikTok videos to your gallery**. But why bother saving when you can watch it online? Let me ask you another one: do you ever find a music clip that relates to your mood or a funny prank to scare your friends? But what if your friends and family aren't on TikTok? Luckily, you can save TikTok videos and re-share them on other apps like Facebook and Instagram.

You can even save TikTok videos for customization with a video editor. After all, your videos need to be unique to win the race. If you are self-obsessed with your created content, you better save it for safekeeping or to show your kids how cool you used to be. Better safe than sorry, right?

## Method 1: Save TikTok Video by the TikTok App Itself

Unlike other apps, TikTok is well aware of our wants and likes. Since we youngsters are the obsessive kind, we love to rewatch our favorite videos countless times until we get bored or move on to the next. Hence TikTok has an in-built option to save TikTok videos to any device, be it a Smartphone or a PC. Better yet, you don't even need to own a TikTok account to save videos. Just install the app and follow these steps. Easy peasy.

1\. Once installed, launch TikTok.

TikTok's hassle-free option will save you a lot of time. You can keep on scrolling and clicking saves to download loads of videos without having to switch from app to app. And it's easier than it sounds—time to quench your video thirst.

## Method 2: Save TikTok Video Online

TikTok downloader, a.k.a TTDownloader is an online tool to help you save your favorite videos from the wonderful library of TikTok. But why use an online tool? Because of the following advantages, it offers:

* Save TikTok video to any device like PC, android, iOS, or tablet.

* Choose to remove the watermark.
* There's no need to download the app. Only the video's URL is needed.

* The platform offers free and unlimited downloads.

I'm sure this is enough to convince you but wait till you see how easy it is to use. Follow these steps and see for yourself what the fuss is all about. Here you go:

4\. Choose the way you want to download your video and click on the 'Download video.' The video will be saved to your gallery within seconds. Easy peasy.

## Method 3: Save TikTok Video by a Third-Party App

TikMate is a TikTok video downloading app available on the Google store. It offers super-fast downloading and is free. You can download unlimited videos, and it doesn't even require logging in. I know that can be tiring and instantly makes you hate the app. With that settled, let me add that it is not just a downloader, but also a video player! How cool. And all the downloaded videos are in the app, so you don't have to search your gallery looking for it.

Some apps have complicated interfaces, but TikMate once again wins us over with its simplicity. Only a few quick steps, and you'll have your favorite video saved.
