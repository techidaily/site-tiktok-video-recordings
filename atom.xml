You have to go through the five easy steps to create a bio for TikTok that will help you be successful. So, let’s dig deeper into those ultimate steps!</p><p><strong>Step 1: Describe your brand.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/describe-account-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="describe account tiktok"                ></p><p>Source: blog.hubspot.com</p><p>Describe your followers who you are and what you do. They may gather some idea of what your profile is about, based on your content. Still, it would help if you didn’t rely on that.</p><p>What if you create a video relevant to you but has nothing to do with your account? Your visitors need to learn another way to know what your business is all about.</p><p>It can be only a few words, so make sure you boil down what people want to know. And ensure your language is compelling, engaging, and gets across your account’s purpose efficiently.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Add emojis.</strong></p><p>Almost every TikTok bio contains an emoji that help you emphasize your brand’s personality and showcase your brand’s services and products without consuming much space in your TikTok bio.</p><p>For example, if you work for an eCommerce brand, particularly in clothing, you might enter a t-shirt emoji (???). Or, if your company sells video tools, you may enter a video camera emoji (???).</p><p>So, these emojis tell people what to do. And, if you want them to hit the follow button or click the link below, you could add arrows to express that without entering extra characters to influence visitors’ action.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Add a CTA.</strong></p><p>Like any attractive social media bio, you should have a CTA in your TikTok bio as well. It exactly tells your visitors what to do next. For example, you might add a CTA to direct followers to an eCommerce website, a blog post link, or another social channel like YouTube or Instagram.</p><p>Always think of including a CTA in almost every video or communication you share with your potential followers.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Don’t exceed the character limit</strong>.</p><p>TikTok has a bio character limit which is further not very big. So you only have 80 characters to summarize your TikTok bio. That’s just over half of the limit present on Instagram handles, which can be pretty tight, one of the factors emojis are super helpful. You can easily save your characters and use them wisely to communicate your brand among the followers fully. Then, pick out the most crucial angles of your brand and showcase those in your TikTok bio.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Add a link in your TikTok bio.</strong></p><p>TikTok gives you a link adding space as well, so if it’s currently accessible in your account, you should use it. And, we’ll also discuss how to add a link to TikTok’s bio, an excellent method to direct traffic off the platform to other promotion pages.</p><p>So, you can direct them to a relevant landing page or e-book and capture their contact info or an email address, or you can share the sales page for the most current product you touted in your video.</p><p>Thus, there are numerous ways you can optimize your TikTok bio ideas.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-a-Link-to-TikTok-Bio"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-a-Link-to-TikTok-Bio" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?"></a>Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?</h2><p>First, to know how to add a link to TikTok bio, you can send traffic to only a single URL. You can select your most recent blog post, a dedicated landing page, your homepage, social media profile, or any other page you’d like.</p><p>The other way is to promote multiple links through a bio service. With this type of service, people can get directed to a web page with a collection of page links to visit.</p><p>You could include affiliate links, blog links, products, or even your other social media handles. Using a TikTok bio link service helps you to give your visitors more ways of connecting with people outside of TikTok.</p><p><strong>Accessing the Link in Bio on TikTok</strong></p><p>Yet, there is a caveat to the <strong>TikTok bio</strong> link option: not everyone can add a link to their <strong>TikTok bio</strong>. Most Android users have this option, while some iOS users are still waiting. Follow the steps below to check:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Hit the <strong>“Edit your profile”</strong> tab</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Check for the option “<strong>Website</strong>“ underneath the section to edit TikTok bio.</p><p>There’s no issue if you don’t have that option. You can join the TikTok Testers program by easily downloading a separate app called <strong>Testflight</strong> through the app store.</p><p>Next, open your current TikTok app and tap the three dots in your profile page’s upper right-hand corner to enter the “<strong>Settings</strong>“ window. Then, scroll down and click <strong>“Join TikTok Testers.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-beta.jpg"                      alt="tiktok beta"                ></p><p>Follow those instructions, and you’ll be able to access the different Beta versions of TikTok after they get released. TikTok provides this facility to ensure that only the best features hit the primary app and keep the app as bug-free as possible.</p><h2 id="Part-3-30-TikTok-Bio-Ideas-in-2024"><a href="#Part-3-30-TikTok-Bio-Ideas-in-2024" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: 30+ TikTok Bio Ideas in 2024"></a>Part 3: 30+ TikTok Bio Ideas in 2024</h2><p>Light travels faster than sound.

You have to go through the five easy steps to create a bio for TikTok that will help you be successful. So, let’s dig deeper into those ultimate steps!</p><p><strong>Step 1: Describe your brand.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/describe-account-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="describe account tiktok"                ></p><p>Source: blog.hubspot.com</p><p>Describe your followers who you are and what you do. They may gather some idea of what your profile is about, based on your content. Still, it would help if you didn’t rely on that.</p><p>What if you create a video relevant to you but has nothing to do with your account? Your visitors need to learn another way to know what your business is all about.</p><p>It can be only a few words, so make sure you boil down what people want to know. And ensure your language is compelling, engaging, and gets across your account’s purpose efficiently.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Add emojis.</strong></p><p>Almost every TikTok bio contains an emoji that help you emphasize your brand’s personality and showcase your brand’s services and products without consuming much space in your TikTok bio.</p><p>For example, if you work for an eCommerce brand, particularly in clothing, you might enter a t-shirt emoji (???). Or, if your company sells video tools, you may enter a video camera emoji (???).</p><p>So, these emojis tell people what to do. And, if you want them to hit the follow button or click the link below, you could add arrows to express that without entering extra characters to influence visitors’ action.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Add a CTA.</strong></p><p>Like any attractive social media bio, you should have a CTA in your TikTok bio as well. It exactly tells your visitors what to do next. For example, you might add a CTA to direct followers to an eCommerce website, a blog post link, or another social channel like YouTube or Instagram.</p><p>Always think of including a CTA in almost every video or communication you share with your potential followers.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Don’t exceed the character limit</strong>.</p><p>TikTok has a bio character limit which is further not very big. So you only have 80 characters to summarize your TikTok bio. That’s just over half of the limit present on Instagram handles, which can be pretty tight, one of the factors emojis are super helpful. You can easily save your characters and use them wisely to communicate your brand among the followers fully. Then, pick out the most crucial angles of your brand and showcase those in your TikTok bio.</p><p><strong>Step 5: Add a link in your TikTok bio.</strong></p><p>TikTok gives you a link adding space as well, so if it’s currently accessible in your account, you should use it. And, we’ll also discuss how to add a link to TikTok’s bio, an excellent method to direct traffic off the platform to other promotion pages.</p><p>So, you can direct them to a relevant landing page or e-book and capture their contact info or an email address, or you can share the sales page for the most current product you touted in your video.</p><p>Thus, there are numerous ways you can optimize your TikTok bio ideas.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-a-Link-to-TikTok-Bio-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-a-Link-to-TikTok-Bio-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?"></a>Part 2: How to Add a Link to TikTok Bio?</h2><p>First, to know how to add a link to TikTok bio, you can send traffic to only a single URL. You can select your most recent blog post, a dedicated landing page, your homepage, social media profile, or any other page you’d like.</p><p>The other way is to promote multiple links through a bio service. With this type of service, people can get directed to a web page with a collection of page links to visit.</p><p>You could include affiliate links, blog links, products, or even your other social media handles. Using a TikTok bio link service helps you to give your visitors more ways of connecting with people outside of TikTok.</p><p><strong>Accessing the Link in Bio on TikTok</strong></p><p>Yet, there is a caveat to the <strong>TikTok bio</strong> link option: not everyone can add a link to their <strong>TikTok bio</strong>. Most Android users have this option, while some iOS users are still waiting. Follow the steps below to check:</p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: Hit the <strong>“Edit your profile”</strong> tab</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Check for the option “<strong>Website</strong>“ underneath the section to edit TikTok bio.</p><p>There’s no issue if you don’t have that option. You can join the TikTok Testers program by easily downloading a separate app called <strong>Testflight</strong> through the app store.</p><p>Next, open your current TikTok app and tap the three dots in your profile page’s upper right-hand corner to enter the “<strong>Settings</strong>“ window. Then, scroll down and click <strong>“Join TikTok Testers.”</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-beta.jpg"                      alt="tiktok beta"                ></p><p>Follow those instructions, and you’ll be able to access the different Beta versions of TikTok after they get released.

Reset the Network"></a>5. Reset the Network</h3><p>TikTok has become a very frequently used app globally, however occasionally its users have to confront certain challenges. Sometimes when viewing or recording a video, an error does not allow the app to play the video. This issue is not directly connected to the app; however, we may solve this mistake by utilizing alternative ways such as network difficulties. Sometimes our network is giving trouble to the system, and it is not supporting the videos we wish to play. So, the first and foremost duty to remove this problem is to examine our connection. To solve the connection difficulties or ISP APN, we need to take the following steps:</p><ul><li><p>Open the settings and click on the network and internet option. From there, click on the mobile network &gt; Open ‘Advanced Options’</p></li><li><p>Click on the access point names and select the three full stops in the upper right corner of your phone’s screen.</p></li><li><p>Then click on reset to default. After performing these instructions leave the settings, then go to your home screen and switch on the mobile data. Then play the video to see whether the fault is fixed.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/tiktok-bugs-6.jpg"                      alt="Mobile Networks"                ></p><h3 id="6-Restart-the-Devices"><a href="#6-Restart-the-Devices" class="headerlink" title="6. Restart the Devices"></a>6. Restart the Devices</h3><p>If TikTok works on another device or browser from the list above, your device seems to be the issue. If the issue continues, consider deleting the program and reinstalling it from the App Store for iOS users or Play Store for Android users. The first thing to do in the case of an application problem on your iPhone device is to switch off then on again. To achieve this, these are the steps to follow:</p><p><strong>For iOS:</strong></p><ul><li><p>To begin, touch and hold the Power button until you receive the “Slide to Power Off” option on your screen. Then move the slider to the right until the screen on your iPhone or iPad becomes dark.</p></li><li><p>Wait at least 10 seconds after shutting off your iPhone before hitting and holding the Power button until the Apple logo shows on the screen.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/tiktok-bugs-7.jpg"                      alt="Hold the Power Button"                ></p><ul><li>Finally, wait for your device to completely boot up before trying to log in to your TikTok account to verify whether the TikTok login problem has been fixed.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/tiktok-bugs-8.jpg"                      alt="Login Tiktok Account"                ></p><p><strong>For Android:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Firstly, find the Power button on your smartphone and hold down the power button until the Power Options menu comes on the screen.</p></li><li><p>After that, hit the Restart button and wait for your device’s screen to turn off fully.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/tiktok-bugs-9.jpg"                      alt="Restart"                ></p><ul><li>Finally, wait for your device to power up entirely. This process may take many minutes to conclude.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/tiktok-bugs-10.jpg"                      alt="Restarting"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-Conclusion"><a href="#Part-4-Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Conclusion"></a>Part 4: Conclusion</h2><p>Sometimes all that TikTok needs is an update. Someone else has undoubtedly run across whatever difficulty you are having earlier and the developer may have published an update that fixes the problem already. If none of the alternatives above work, remove your <strong>TikTok app</strong> according to your device. Go to the App Store or Google Play Store. Search for the <strong>TikTok</strong> <strong>application</strong> and install it. If you are on an Android smartphone, go to the Play Store, search for TikTok, and check if there is an update available. For an iOS device, visit the App Store, press on your profile symbol, then scroll down to check if there’s an update. Summing up, these are the few reliable ways to fix your <strong>TikTok bugs</strong> handily.</p><p>Part 2.

Sometimes when viewing or recording a video, an error does not allow the app to play the video. This issue is not directly connected to the app; however, we may solve this mistake by utilizing alternative ways such as network difficulties. Sometimes our network is giving trouble to the system, and it is not supporting the videos we wish to play. So, the first and foremost duty to remove this problem is to examine our connection. To solve the connection difficulties or ISP APN, we need to take the following steps:</p><ul><li><p>Open the settings and click on the network and internet option. From there, click on the mobile network &gt; Open ‘Advanced Options’</p></li><li><p>Click on the access point names and select the three full stops in the upper right corner of your phone’s screen.</p></li><li><p>Then click on reset to default.

If the issue continues, consider deleting the program and reinstalling it from the App Store for iOS users or Play Store for Android users. The first thing to do in the case of an application problem on your iPhone device is to switch off then on again. To achieve this, these are the steps to follow:</p><p><strong>For iOS:</strong></p><ul><li><p>To begin, touch and hold the Power button until you receive the “Slide to Power Off” option on your screen. Then move the slider to the right until the screen on your iPhone or iPad becomes dark.</p></li><li><p>Wait at least 10 seconds after shutting off your iPhone before hitting and holding the Power button until the Apple logo shows on the screen.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/tiktok-bugs-7.jpg"                      alt="Hold the Power Button"                ></p><ul><li>Finally, wait for your device to completely boot up before trying to log in to your TikTok account to verify whether the TikTok login problem has been fixed.</li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/tiktok-bugs-8.jpg"                      alt="Login Tiktok Account"                ></p><p><strong>For Android:</strong></p><ul><li><p>Firstly, find the Power button on your smartphone and hold down the power button until the Power Options menu comes on the screen.</p></li><li><p>After that, hit the Restart button and wait for your device’s screen to turn off fully.</p></li></ul><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/tiktok-bugs-9.jpg"                      alt="Restart"                ></p><ul><li>Finally, wait for your device to power up entirely.

Anyone can go viral and become TikTok famous by gaining more likes, lots of views, and video shares. TikTok’s algorithm can put your videos at the top of the “For You” scroll and turn you into a sensation overnight, thus skyrocketing your followers count in a matter of few days. But, did you know that TikTok removed almost 50 million videos in just 6 months because those videos violated its rules?</p><p>While this social media site can easily be your shot to fame, it can even take away your audience. Or worse, it can ban you from using the app if you do not follow its community guidelines and rules. And, if you’ve been on TikTok for a while now, chances are you’ve heard about users getting ‘shadowbanned’. It’s not unusual for users to unknowingly stop receiving likes, views, and traffic on their accounts due to <strong>TikTok shadowban</strong>.</p><p>Ever since the influx of social media, shadow banning, also known as ghost banning or stealth banning, has been around. It comes up when content has been blocked or partially blocked. Sadly, when your TikTok account is shadowbanned, it will negatively affect your reach and halt your growth. Influencers and businesses rely on social media to create a community. And when they lose a part of that community, they feel a loss of support.</p><p>Wondering what shadowbanning entails, how to determine if you’ve been shadowbanned, and <strong>how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok</strong>?

Basically, it means your account has been banned. But, the shadow part of the term means that you won’t know about the ban.</p><p>Shadowban on TikTok is a restriction that prevents your videos from appearing on the <strong>For You</strong> page or on hashtag results. It is a situation where your visibility has been reduced or where you have been banned from the platform, without your knowledge.</p><p>The act of shadowbanning a TikTok account is an automatic process done by TikTok’s algorithm to protect other users against spam content, copyright issues, and adult content. When you get shadowbanned, you stop receiving likes, views, and traffic from the For You page. Often, shadowbans go unnoticed until another user who stumbled upon your video points it out.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban"><a href="#Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?"></a>Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?</h2><p>At the early stages of TikTok, shadowbans lasted for 24 hours. But, with the latest update in the TikTok algorithm, the length of TikTok shadowban is growing. Nowadays, a TikTok account is shadowbanned for approximately up to 2 weeks.</p><p>Within the first week, there will be a drop in your followers and so will the views. After a few days of the account shadowban being in place, you won’t be able to enter any tags or make new videos on TikTok unless they are public.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-shadowban.png"                      alt="tiktok shadowban"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?"></a>Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?</h2><p>The TikTok app doesn’t ever actually tell if you are shadowbanned. But, if you are then you can probably notice it. If you are shadowbanned, your videos will neither show up on the TikTok “For You” page nor will they appear when you search them via hashtag.</p><p>During a TikTok shadowban, your videos and content will not:</p><ul><li>be visible in the search results</li><li>be visible on the feed</li><li>receive new followers</li><li>receive likes from others</li><li>receive comments from others</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok"><a href="#Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?"></a>Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?</h2><p>TikTok has not issued any explanation on its shadowbanning techniques. However, what makes complete sense is that TikTok shadowbans its users for creating videos that violate its community guidelines.</p><p>Any video with offensive content that can harm the sentiments of people or anything that can trigger other users can attract TikTok shadowban. The app might limit the visibility of your content for reasons such as your account acting as spam or you are posting inappropriate content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shadowbanned-on-tiktok.png"                      alt="shadowbanned on tiktok"                ></p><p><strong>Spam Behavior</strong></p><p>The primary reason why a user’s TikTok account can get shadowbanned is that they behave like a spammer. Usually, new people go on a spree of liking and following people in the hope that they will like and follow back. However, TikTok might recognize this behavior as spam and consider you as a robot.</p><p>If you like more than 100 posts daily, you might want to slow down. If you follow more than 50 TikTok accounts in a day, it is best to re-evaluate that strategy.</p><p><strong>Inappropriate Content</strong></p><p>Posting videos that go against the TikTok rules and community guidelines can get you shadowbanned or permanently banned.</p><p>The following content is considered inappropriate by TikTok:</p><ul><li>hate speech</li><li>fake news</li><li>violence</li><li>nudity</li><li>drugs</li><li>copyrighted music</li></ul><p>TikTok is committed to make its platform an inclusive and safe space.

Basically, it means your account has been banned. But, the shadow part of the term means that you won’t know about the ban.</p><p>Shadowban on TikTok is a restriction that prevents your videos from appearing on the <strong>For You</strong> page or on hashtag results. It is a situation where your visibility has been reduced or where you have been banned from the platform, without your knowledge.</p><p>The act of shadowbanning a TikTok account is an automatic process done by TikTok’s algorithm to protect other users against spam content, copyright issues, and adult content. When you get shadowbanned, you stop receiving likes, views, and traffic from the For You page. Often, shadowbans go unnoticed until another user who stumbled upon your video points it out.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?"></a>Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?</h2><p>At the early stages of TikTok, shadowbans lasted for 24 hours. But, with the latest update in the TikTok algorithm, the length of TikTok shadowban is growing. Nowadays, a TikTok account is shadowbanned for approximately up to 2 weeks.</p><p>Within the first week, there will be a drop in your followers and so will the views. After a few days of the account shadowban being in place, you won’t be able to enter any tags or make new videos on TikTok unless they are public.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-shadowban.png"                      alt="tiktok shadowban"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned-1"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?"></a>Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?</h2><p>The TikTok app doesn’t ever actually tell if you are shadowbanned. But, if you are then you can probably notice it. If you are shadowbanned, your videos will neither show up on the TikTok “For You” page nor will they appear when you search them via hashtag.</p><p>During a TikTok shadowban, your videos and content will not:</p><ul><li>be visible in the search results</li><li>be visible on the feed</li><li>receive new followers</li><li>receive likes from others</li><li>receive comments from others</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok-1"><a href="#Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?"></a>Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?</h2><p>TikTok has not issued any explanation on its shadowbanning techniques. However, what makes complete sense is that TikTok shadowbans its users for creating videos that violate its community guidelines.</p><p>Any video with offensive content that can harm the sentiments of people or anything that can trigger other users can attract TikTok shadowban. The app might limit the visibility of your content for reasons such as your account acting as spam or you are posting inappropriate content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shadowbanned-on-tiktok.png"                      alt="shadowbanned on tiktok"                ></p><p><strong>Spam Behavior</strong></p><p>The primary reason why a user’s TikTok account can get shadowbanned is that they behave like a spammer. Usually, new people go on a spree of liking and following people in the hope that they will like and follow back. However, TikTok might recognize this behavior as spam and consider you as a robot.</p><p>If you like more than 100 posts daily, you might want to slow down. If you follow more than 50 TikTok accounts in a day, it is best to re-evaluate that strategy.</p><p><strong>Inappropriate Content</strong></p><p>Posting videos that go against the TikTok rules and community guidelines can get you shadowbanned or permanently banned.</p><p>The following content is considered inappropriate by TikTok:</p><ul><li>hate speech</li><li>fake news</li><li>violence</li><li>nudity</li><li>drugs</li><li>copyrighted music</li></ul><p>TikTok is committed to make its platform an inclusive and safe space. So, if you have experienced a drop in views or engagement, consider reassessing your recent content.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Fix-TikTok-Shadowban-and-Get-Unshadowbanned-1"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Fix-TikTok-Shadowban-and-Get-Unshadowbanned-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?"></a>Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?</h2><p>Wondering about how do you get unshadowbanned on TikTok?

If it doesn’t work, uninstall and then reinstall the TikTok app. Sometimes, your app might just need an update to become functional once again.</p><h4 id="Switch-to-A-Pro-Account-2"><a href="#Switch-to-A-Pro-Account-2" class="headerlink" title="Switch to A Pro Account"></a>Switch to A Pro Account</h4><p>When doing a Google search on how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok, the most common tip you’ll find is to go into the Settings of your TikTok account and tap “Switch to a Pro Account”. The reason is that making the switch will allow you to see analytics for your posts and find out how people access your videos.

If you go back to posting the same kind of content that got you banned in the first place, you will be booted off the stage again.</p><p>Ensure you always post original content with innovative ideas. Brainstorm new ideas with your team and come up with something new and unique. This way, you can avoid copyright infringement laws on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Know-Your-Audience-More-2"><a href="#Know-Your-Audience-More-2" class="headerlink" title="Know Your Audience More"></a>Know Your Audience More</h4><p>These days, there are many kids and minor accounts on TikTok, and maintaining a healthy environment is a part of your responsibility.

Anyone can go viral and become TikTok famous by gaining more likes, lots of views, and video shares. TikTok’s algorithm can put your videos at the top of the “For You” scroll and turn you into a sensation overnight, thus skyrocketing your followers count in a matter of few days. But, did you know that TikTok removed almost 50 million videos in just 6 months because those videos violated its rules?</p><p>While this social media site can easily be your shot to fame, it can even take away your audience. Or worse, it can ban you from using the app if you do not follow its community guidelines and rules. And, if you’ve been on TikTok for a while now, chances are you’ve heard about users getting ‘shadowbanned’. It’s not unusual for users to unknowingly stop receiving likes, views, and traffic on their accounts due to <strong>TikTok shadowban</strong>.</p><p>Ever since the influx of social media, shadow banning, also known as ghost banning or stealth banning, has been around. It comes up when content has been blocked or partially blocked. Sadly, when your TikTok account is shadowbanned, it will negatively affect your reach and halt your growth. Influencers and businesses rely on social media to create a community. And when they lose a part of that community, they feel a loss of support.</p><p>Wondering what shadowbanning entails, how to determine if you’ve been shadowbanned, and <strong>how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok</strong>?

If it doesn’t work, uninstall and then reinstall the TikTok app. Sometimes, your app might just need an update to become functional once again.</p><h4 id="Switch-to-A-Pro-Account-3"><a href="#Switch-to-A-Pro-Account-3" class="headerlink" title="Switch to A Pro Account"></a>Switch to A Pro Account</h4><p>When doing a Google search on how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok, the most common tip you’ll find is to go into the Settings of your TikTok account and tap “Switch to a Pro Account”. The reason is that making the switch will allow you to see analytics for your posts and find out how people access your videos. By doing this, you can easily monitor how far your engagement has increased or dropped.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-pro-account.jpg"                      alt="tiktok pro account"                ></p><h4 id="Delete-Offensive-Content-3"><a href="#Delete-Offensive-Content-3" class="headerlink" title="Delete Offensive Content"></a>Delete Offensive Content</h4><p>You should delete content that goes against the rules and community guidelines laid down by TikTok. After deleting inappropriate content, you have to wait for at least two weeks to get the shadowban lifted. You can refresh your device once in a while to check if you have finally managed to lift the ban.</p><h4 id="Put-TikTok-On-Hold-for-Sometime-3"><a href="#Put-TikTok-On-Hold-for-Sometime-3" class="headerlink" title="Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime"></a>Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime</h4><p>Once you have deleted offensive content, clear the cache, close your app, ensure it is updated and then take a break from TikTok for a few days. Coming back after you have cleaned up your account and taken the needed break might get you unshadowbanned on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Post-Original-Innovative-Content-3"><a href="#Post-Original-Innovative-Content-3" class="headerlink" title="Post Original, Innovative Content"></a>Post Original, Innovative Content</h4><p>When you return to posting content, you need to make sure your TikTok account doesn’t get shadowbanned again. Your account has already been flagged for something and so you need to try even harder to behave. If you go back to posting the same kind of content that got you banned in the first place, you will be booted off the stage again.</p><p>Ensure you always post original content with innovative ideas. Brainstorm new ideas with your team and come up with something new and unique. This way, you can avoid copyright infringement laws on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Know-Your-Audience-More-3"><a href="#Know-Your-Audience-More-3" class="headerlink" title="Know Your Audience More"></a>Know Your Audience More</h4><p>These days, there are many kids and minor accounts on TikTok, and maintaining a healthy environment is a part of your responsibility. Keep your videos free from sexualized themes, nudity, pornographic material, and suggestive themes. Remember; posting such content can land you in serious trouble with TikTok shadowban.</p><h2 id="Part-6-Use-Excellent-Video-Editors-to-Make-Amazing-TikTok-Videos-3"><a href="#Part-6-Use-Excellent-Video-Editors-to-Make-Amazing-TikTok-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Use Excellent Video Editors to Make Amazing TikTok Videos"></a>Part 6: Use Excellent Video Editors to Make Amazing TikTok Videos</h2><p>With increasing competition among TikTok users, it is important to use a powerful video editing tool to make your TikTok videos stand out.

Navigte the video that you wish to download, and click on the Share icon, scroll to the side and save the video as a live photo by clicking on <strong>Save as Live Photo.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/download-tiktok-video-as-live-photo.jpg"                      alt="download  tiktok video as live photo"                ></p><p> <strong>Step 2: Open Gallery and Save Downloaded Live Photo as Video</strong></p><p>Now, open the video you have just exported from TikTok in your Phone’s Gallery.

For iPhone users, Siri is not new. Siri helps them read text messages and much more, but soon after the text-to-speech feature was added in TikTok, it took the TikTokers world by storm. But since the voice sounded so much like Siri, people started calling it Siri voice rather than text-to-speech. This feature allows users to convert any text into a speech using an automated voice. And if you have never used the text-to-speech feature, this post will help you understand <strong>how to do the Siri voice on TikTok.</strong></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is Siri Voice?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">TikTok Voice Changer Apps</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Siri-Voice"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Siri-Voice" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Siri Voice?"></a>Part 1: What is Siri Voice?</h2><p>Siri voice in TikTok is basically an automated voice feature where the voice reads out the text on the video. The feature is called text-to-speech. So, whenever you enable it on your video, the text will be read out loud, which makes the video watching experience fun. Therefore, those who want to add a voice to their TikTok videos can use the text-to-speech feature and let the automated voice do that talking.</p><p>You will find almost everyone using it, even those who often use their voice in TikTok videos, and that’s because many TikTok users find it entertaining and funny. Well, no matter why you want to use this feature, find out <strong>how to do Siri voice on TikTok</strong> without any hassle in the next part!</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Do-Siri-Voice-on-TikTok"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Do-Siri-Voice-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?"></a>Part 2: How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?</h2><p>To do Siri voice on TikTok, you will have to follow just a few simple steps. Here are the steps that you need to take care of:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch TikTok on your mobile phone.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start recording a video; else, upload an already recorded video.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap the Upload button and then click on the checkmark.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, begin writing something on the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Tap on the text you have just written, and you will see the Text-to-Speech option.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Click on that and hear the automated voice reading your text. Now, upload the videos, and that’s it. All done!</p><h2 id="Part-3-Don’t-Like-the-Siri-Voice-on-TikTok-Try-These-TikTok-Voice-Changer-Apps"><a href="#Part-3-Don’t-Like-the-Siri-Voice-on-TikTok-Try-These-TikTok-Voice-Changer-Apps" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Don’t Like the Siri Voice on TikTok? Try These TikTok Voice Changer Apps"></a>Part 3: Don’t Like the Siri Voice on TikTok? Try These TikTok Voice Changer Apps</h2><p>If you are not impressed with the Siri voice on TikTok and would instead like to use some other fun and peppy voice for the text, the good news is there are tons of apps that can help you do that. But before we share the names of the apps, let’s throw some light on why people are looking for such apps. First, if you are using TikTok’s text-to-speech feature in North America, you will hear a computer-automated female voice who will read out the text of the video.</p><p>But, when it comes to the UK, the app uses a computer-generated male voice with a rockin’ accent instead of a female voice. However, recently the voiceover artist of the female voice has filed a lawsuit against the company, saying that she never permitted TikTok to use her voice for text-to-speech, which is why TikTok is now using a cheerful valley girl voice for the text-to-speech feature. Unfortunately, TikTok users are not happy with the new voice, making them look for the best TikTok voice generator apps.</p><p>If you also want to add another voice for the text-to-speech, here are our hand-picked top and best 5 TikTok voice generator apps for iOS and Android.</p><h3 id="1-Voice-Changer"><a href="#1-Voice-Changer" class="headerlink" title="1.

For changing this position, you need to apply little smartness and effort to emerge victorious in this race.

So, follow the tips we will share here carefully, and in no time, you can be one of those whose accounts with multiple followers. With a bit of patience in your hand, let’s start reading the suggestions one by one with complete confidence to learn about the most liked video on TikTok.</p><p><strong>Tip 1: Adding Tags</strong></p><p>Despite adding Tags sounding simpler, it gives prodigious results for uploaded videos or your account. To avoid these unprecedented results, you need to put some valuable hashtags (the symbol “# followed by a short text without space”) at the end or in the middle of the post. It tells about the video genre.</p><p>As a result, whenever a user clicks on any hashtags, they get to view your video content or file directly. Additionally, they will get to your content area, thereby boosting your post. This is how you get views on TikTok.</p><p><strong>Tip 2: ‘For You’ page</strong></p><p>Involving&#x2F; including the front page is another valuable trick: the users ‘For You’ page. It would suggest and direct the users’ content, videos of their interest based on their search history or essential links. As a result, there will be a range of interests when any user lands on your page.</p><p>It will force them to revisit your profile at the end. Additionally, you will get an idea of the most liked video on the TikTok profile, thereby focusing on that department.</p><p><strong>Tip 3: Interaction with TikTok users, with comments</strong></p><p>Your users are the natural source for promoting your profile in the TikTok world. To better know how to get more views and likes on TikTok, you better interact with them as much as possible. Actively write comments. Whenever users visit your profile and see you write regularly, they are most likely to revert to your account or profile.</p><p><strong>Tip 4: Your profile must be complete</strong></p><p>In my view, TikTok profile competition is a very crucial tip as it keeps your profile up-to-date. Leaving a positive impression on users is vital, making it possible. Similarly, whoever lands on your profile will feel the appropriateness of the content.

TikTok lacks a feature that allows users to see which accounts have viewed their videos. It means that while you may not see who is viewing your videos, your viewing habits are also left anonymous. Thus, you wouldn’t be able to access the TikTok profile view.</p><p>TikTok only indicates how many people viewed the post instead of showing who has viewed your videos profile.</p><p>TikTok users can see who comments on their videos as well as who creates “duets” or “stitches” (essentially video edits) of their content using the <strong>Activity</strong> tab on the app.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-View-Someone’s-TikTok-Profile-without-them-Knowing-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-View-Someone’s-TikTok-Profile-without-them-Knowing-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to View Someone’s TikTok Profile without them Knowing?"></a>Part 2: How to View Someone’s TikTok Profile without them Knowing?</h2><p>To view someone’s profile without them knowing, you need to upgrade to the latest updated TikTok app. TikTok will only indicate the number of viewers but no further information on who those viewers are.</p><p>It means you are already viewing others’ TikTok profiles without them knowing.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-to-Change-Profile-Picture-on-TikTok-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-to-Change-Profile-Picture-on-TikTok-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How to Change Profile Picture on TikTok"></a>Part 3: How to Change Profile Picture on TikTok</h2><p>You’ve got only two ways to represent yourself on TikTok with your profile picture and videos. Of course, the profile picture you put shows up on the profile page and every video posted.</p><p>Like many other apps, your profile icon can get changed whenever you feel like it. TikTok has an added advantage since it gives more options for changing your icon. You can have a profile video.</p><p>Additionally, there’s an easy way to download a profile picture you like on someone else’s profile.</p><p><strong>Steps to change your profile picture on TikTok</strong></p><p>You can pick a photo you have saved or take a new one when you change your picture. Make sure you’ve kept the image you wish to upload before proceeding.</p><p>Step 1: Open TikTok and head to your profile by tapping the Profile option in the bottom-right corner.</p><p>Step 2: Tap the Edit profile option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/edit-profile-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="edit profile tiktok"                ></p><p>Step 3: Select either <strong>Change photo</strong> or <strong>Change video</strong>, depending on what you want. If you’re changing the photograph, you can take a new one or select the one you had saved earlier; if you’re adding a video, choose the one you’ve saved already.</p><p>A quick tip: Any video uploaded needs to be between three and six seconds long. A longer one will have to get trimmed first.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/change-tiktok-profile.jpg"                      alt="change tiktok profile"                ></p><p>Step 4: Once you’ve picked your new icon, crop it, then hit Save.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/save-tiktok-profile.jpg"                      alt="save tiktok profile"                ></p><p>Your desired profile photo or video will be uploaded immediately and appear on your profile. Whenever you want to change your profile video or image again, repeat the abovementioned steps.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: If you’ve uploaded both a picture and a video, the video is always what will appear as your profile icon. If you want people to see the image instead, head back to the <strong>Edit profile</strong> menu for the TikTok profile view, tap your video, and select <strong>Remove video</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/remove-tiktok-profile.jpg"                      alt="remove tiktok profile"                ></p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Edit-TikTok-Profile-on-PC-Include-already-uploaded-TikTok-3"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Edit-TikTok-Profile-on-PC-Include-already-uploaded-TikTok-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Edit TikTok Profile on PC (Include already uploaded TikTok)?"></a>Part 4: How to Edit TikTok Profile on PC (Include already uploaded TikTok)?</h2><p>On the already updated TikTok, it is impossible to change the profile picture on PC because it is limited. The only possible way to make changes is through an Android or iOS device. However, if using a PC and need to make those changes, you can use TikTok on BlueStacks with zero troubles.</p><p>BlueStacks acts as an android emulator, which enables the running of the TikTok mobile app on the PC. You will only need to save the video or image on BlueStacks by using the option ‘Save to Album.’ For all this to be possible, first update the graphics driver and allocate a minimum of 1500MB RAM. After opening the app, navigate to the ‘App Centre’ then sign in with your Google account. Type ‘TikTok’ and then click it to install and open at the search option.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Optimize-TikTok-Profile-in-2022-3"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Optimize-TikTok-Profile-in-2022-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Optimize TikTok Profile in 2022?"></a>Part 5: How to Optimize TikTok Profile in 2022?</h2><p>At the initial stage, it is normal not to get more likes and views on TikTok. For changing this position, you need to apply little smartness and effort to emerge victorious in this race. Inescapably by using new tactics, coming across the crowd with the victorious song will be a swift game to you. So, follow the tips we will share here carefully, and in no time, you can be one of those whose accounts with multiple followers. With a bit of patience in your hand, let’s start reading the suggestions one by one with complete confidence to learn about the most liked video on TikTok.</p><p><strong>Tip 1: Adding Tags</strong></p><p>Despite adding Tags sounding simpler, it gives prodigious results for uploaded videos or your account. To avoid these unprecedented results, you need to put some valuable hashtags (the symbol “# followed by a short text without space”) at the end or in the middle of the post. It tells about the video genre.</p><p>As a result, whenever a user clicks on any hashtags, they get to view your video content or file directly. Additionally, they will get to your content area, thereby boosting your post. This is how you get views on TikTok.</p><p><strong>Tip 2: ‘For You’ page</strong></p><p>Involving&#x2F; including the front page is another valuable trick: the users ‘For You’ page. It would suggest and direct the users’ content, videos of their interest based on their search history or essential links. As a result, there will be a range of interests when any user lands on your page.</p><p>It will force them to revisit your profile at the end. Additionally, you will get an idea of the most liked video on the TikTok profile, thereby focusing on that department.</p><p><strong>Tip 3: Interaction with TikTok users, with comments</strong></p><p>Your users are the natural source for promoting your profile in the TikTok world. To better know how to get more views and likes on TikTok, you better interact with them as much as possible. Actively write comments. Whenever users visit your profile and see you write regularly, they are most likely to revert to your account or profile.</p><p><strong>Tip 4: Your profile must be complete</strong></p><p>In my view, TikTok profile competition is a very crucial tip as it keeps your profile up-to-date. Leaving a positive impression on users is vital, making it possible. Similarly, whoever lands on your profile will feel the appropriateness of the content. Presenting your profile to users so that it looks attractive and professional is critical nowadays.</p><p><strong>Tip 5: Create original videos</strong></p><p>If you are an active TikToker, you must be aware of the importance of content originality. It is highly advisable to be serious about posting authentic video content. To be outstanding, avoid any piracy and make original videos only.</p><p><strong>Tip 6: Linking TikTok account to other media platforms too like Facebook</strong></p><p>Linking other social media platforms like Facebook to your TikTok account is highly recommended. As a result, whoever visits your Facebook page and clicks on the TikTok link present, will reach your TikTok account, thereby indirectly boosting your account and answering to getting more views on TikTok.</p><p><strong>Tip 7: Use Powerful Video Editing Tool</strong></p><p>You should present your story in an exciting way, such as modifying the video, adding effects, and using many more exciting ways to create and add products to your video.

Let’s have a look:</p><h3 id="1-Tiktok-Video-Requirements"><a href="#1-Tiktok-Video-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="1. Tiktok Video Requirements"></a><strong>1. Tiktok Video Requirements</strong></h3><p>The first and most important thing that you need to know and understand is the requirement of a Tiktok video. The aspect ratio, the dimension, the orientation, and of course, the length!</p><p><strong>Aspect Ratio:</strong> The majority of the people use Tiktok on their smartphones, so the aspect ratio for a Tiktok video should be 9:16 or 1:1 if there are sidebars.</p><p><strong>Dimension:</strong> The recommended dimension for a Tiktok video is 1080 x 1920.</p><p><strong>Video Orientation:</strong> As mentioned earlier, users usually watch Tiktok videos on their smartphones, so a video with a vertical orientation is much easier to watch compared to a video in landscape mode for which one has to tilt their phones.</p><p><strong>Video Length:</strong> Tiktok videos are usually 15 to 60 seconds long depending on the content, but my advice would be to keep them short, as people usually watch shorter videos till the end and might get bored if the video is too long.</p><p><strong>Video File Size:</strong> The file size for iOS devices is 287.6 MB max, and for Android, it is 72 MB.</p><p><strong>Supported Format:</strong> The video format compatible with Tiktok is MP4 and MOV.</p><p>If you keep these basic requirements in mind and make videos that fall within these criteria, I’m sure your videos will be watch-worthy.

Best Practices to Make Successful Tiktok Videos</strong></h3><p>Tiktok video requirements will help you create videos with the perfect orientation, dimension, and aspect ratio. However, if you want to make videos that get millions of views, go viral, and increase your followers, you must know the best practices to make successful Tiktok videos.</p><p>For instance:</p><p><strong>Post Frequently:</strong> If you want to appear on the FYP, you must post often! The more videos you post, the more the chances to come in front of the audience. And, when the audience sees you regularly, they will get acquainted and start following you to see more of your content.</p><p><strong>Follow the Trends:</strong> Tiktok is all about trends. Something goes viral, and everyone starts making the same content to jump on the bandwagon. The trick is to make the same thing in a unique way. Therefore…</p><p><strong>Be Authentic:</strong> The only way you can be unique is to be authentic, be you! If you keep your originality intact even when following the trend, chances are the audience might just click with your content.</p><p><strong>Choose a Niche:</strong> While, Tiktok is known for having all sorts of video content, ranging from comedy, to sad, to just being motivational, you need to find something you’re good at. For instance, if you can sing well, you can post videos of you singing famous songs. Or, if you can paint well, you can post videos of you painting something. You will reach the right audience, and they will follow you!</p><p>If you ask me, I could watch ASMR cooking videos for hours!</p><h2 id="3-Methods-to-Find-a-Viral-Titok-Topic"><a href="#3-Methods-to-Find-a-Viral-Titok-Topic" class="headerlink" title="3.

Requirements for TikTok Video Cover"></a><strong>1. Requirements for TikTok Video Cover</strong></h3><p>A thumbnail or video cover is a crucial deciding factor whether to click and watch a TikTok video or not.

Best Practices to Make an Attractive TikTok Cover"></a><strong>2. Best Practices to Make an Attractive TikTok Cover</strong></h3><p>If you want to create an attractive TikTok video cover, here’s what you need to do:</p><p><strong>Include Text:</strong> A title text on the video cover explains the exact purpose of your video. This helps people decide whether they want to consume the content or not.</p><p>For example, if I come across a TikTok video with the title text that says, “5 Tips To Make Your Cat Love You,” I would probably not click on it because I’m not a cat person. However, people with cats would waste no time watching the same video.</p><p>Additionally, a title text can also create a sense of curiosity for the audience and compels them to click and see what happens next. For instance, a TikTok video titled “I Almost Died!” will create suspense, and people will definitely want to know what happened.</p><p><strong>Use a Good Font Style:</strong> I always recommend using a clear, bold font style as it is easy to read. If you use an excessively curvy style or one that does not have clear letters, the audience might have difficulty reading it on the first attempt.</p><p>Also, staying consistent with a specific font style for your thumbnails helps you stand out. People will start recognizing your videos even before looking at the name.</p><p>So, choose your font wisely!</p><p><strong>Use Pleasant-Looking Contrast:</strong> Here, we are referring to the background color and the font color. Make sure they complement each other! If you’re using a light background, make sure the title text font is dark and vice versa.</p><p><strong>Add Few Objects Only:</strong> Make sure your TikTok video cover does not have too many objects in it. Stick to a simple text, an image, and a background. Adding an image, bold font style, bright background, and throwing in a couple of stickers may give a cluttered look. The trick is to keep it simple and neat.</p><p>With that sorted, let me show a few examples of TikTok video covers that successfully do the trick!</p><h2 id="3-Best-Examples-for-TikTok-Video-Cover"><a href="#3-Best-Examples-for-TikTok-Video-Cover" class="headerlink" title="3.

Best Examples for Tiktok Videos"></a><strong>4. Best Examples for Tiktok Videos</strong></h2><p>So, what kind of videos should you make to get to the top on Tiktok? Here are a few examples:</p><p><strong>Challenges:</strong> One way to create a viral video is to go for social media challenges. People come up with challenge videos every now and then, and the whole world gets into the groove, like that ice bucket challenge from 2014 or the Cotton Eyed Joe challenge from 2021.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKavSXN/" >https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKavSXN/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Dance Videos:</strong> Social media challenges are one thing, but viral dance videos take the fun to the next level. So, if you think you can dance, and add a bit of creativity to it, make a dance challenge video. If you’re good at it, you’ll definitely gain some followers.</p><p><strong>Lip Sync Videos:</strong> Another way to go viral on Tiktok is to make lip-sync videos. The trick is to see who can do it without messing up the lyrics. Like this viral song “Already Best Friends” by Sagittarius Kween:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKanPpe/" >https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKanPpe/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Art Videos:</strong> If you can make art, you can go viral in no time! Take out those paints, colors, and pens, and create a time-lapse painting! Something like this:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKab37F/" >https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKab37F/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Satisfying ASMR Videos:</strong> Satisfying ASMR videos are getting increasingly popular. And, by getting a decent noise-canceling mic, you can easily create such videos and increase your followers.</p><p>Like this kinetic sand ASMR video:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKmhDyT/" >https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKmhDyT/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Makeup Videos:</strong> Makeup tutorials are not only taking over Tiktok but they can be found on other social media platforms as well, with insane followers and subscribers! If you have the knack to create unique looks with makeup, try your hand at this!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKmxt1V/" >https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKmxt1V/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>These are just examples of the kind of videos that get viral on Tiktok. If you have skills similar to the videos mentioned above, or if you have any other skill for that matter, get on Tiktok, make a video, and get famous!</p><h2 id="Tiktok-Video-Caption-3"><a href="#Tiktok-Video-Caption-3" class="headerlink" title="Tiktok Video Caption"></a><strong>Tiktok Video Caption</strong></h2><p>Once you have created an engaging Tiktok video, the next part is to write an attractive caption for it.</p><h3 id="1-Best-Practices-to-Write-Attractive-Tiktok-Captions-3"><a href="#1-Best-Practices-to-Write-Attractive-Tiktok-Captions-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Best Practices to Write Attractive Tiktok Captions"></a><strong>1. Best Practices to Write Attractive Tiktok Captions</strong></h3><p>Here are some tips to help your videos go viral due to the captions:</p><p><strong>Quotes:</strong> A caption can be any line that describes the video or a quote just to grab attention. You can use famous quotes or a dialogue that’s trending to make your caption attractive.</p><p><strong>Hashtags:</strong> You can also use viral hashtags in your captions to make your video appear on the FYP or if someone searches for that particular hashtag. Another tip is to use generic hashtags alongside the viral ones, like #Art #Funny #Asmr, etc.</p><p><strong>Mentions:</strong> Mentioning famous Tiktok accounts in your caption can also make people watch your video.</p><p><strong>Emojis:</strong> Using emojis in the caption is a good idea to grab attention and make it worth reading.</p><p>We’re done with how to make watch-worthy Tiktok videos and add engaging captions. But did you know that the video cover also plays an essential role in getting more views?</p><h2 id="Tiktok-Video-Cover-3"><a href="#Tiktok-Video-Cover-3" class="headerlink" title="Tiktok Video Cover"></a><strong>Tiktok Video Cover</strong></h2><p>Like influencers use catchy thumbnails for their YouTube videos; similarly, TikTok videos also have video covers. So, what should one do to make an attractive TikTok cover?</p><h3 id="1-Requirements-for-TikTok-Video-Cover-3"><a href="#1-Requirements-for-TikTok-Video-Cover-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Requirements for TikTok Video Cover"></a><strong>1. Requirements for TikTok Video Cover</strong></h3><p>A thumbnail or video cover is a crucial deciding factor whether to click and watch a TikTok video or not. Therefore, when choosing a cover for your video, make sure it:</p><ul><li>Accurately portrays the content</li><li>Creates excitement among the audience</li><li>Catches their attention</li></ul><p>If you succeed in doing these 3 things, the audience will be definitely compelled to click on your video!</p><h3 id="2-Best-Practices-to-Make-an-Attractive-TikTok-Cover-3"><a href="#2-Best-Practices-to-Make-an-Attractive-TikTok-Cover-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Best Practices to Make an Attractive TikTok Cover"></a><strong>2. Best Practices to Make an Attractive TikTok Cover</strong></h3><p>If you want to create an attractive TikTok video cover, here’s what you need to do:</p><p><strong>Include Text:</strong> A title text on the video cover explains the exact purpose of your video. This helps people decide whether they want to consume the content or not.</p><p>For example, if I come across a TikTok video with the title text that says, “5 Tips To Make Your Cat Love You,” I would probably not click on it because I’m not a cat person. However, people with cats would waste no time watching the same video.</p><p>Additionally, a title text can also create a sense of curiosity for the audience and compels them to click and see what happens next. For instance, a TikTok video titled “I Almost Died!” will create suspense, and people will definitely want to know what happened.</p><p><strong>Use a Good Font Style:</strong> I always recommend using a clear, bold font style as it is easy to read. If you use an excessively curvy style or one that does not have clear letters, the audience might have difficulty reading it on the first attempt.</p><p>Also, staying consistent with a specific font style for your thumbnails helps you stand out. People will start recognizing your videos even before looking at the name.</p><p>So, choose your font wisely!</p><p><strong>Use Pleasant-Looking Contrast:</strong> Here, we are referring to the background color and the font color. Make sure they complement each other! If you’re using a light background, make sure the title text font is dark and vice versa.</p><p><strong>Add Few Objects Only:</strong> Make sure your TikTok video cover does not have too many objects in it. Stick to a simple text, an image, and a background. Adding an image, bold font style, bright background, and throwing in a couple of stickers may give a cluttered look. The trick is to keep it simple and neat.</p><p>With that sorted, let me show a few examples of TikTok video covers that successfully do the trick!</p><h2 id="3-Best-Examples-for-TikTok-Video-Cover-3"><a href="#3-Best-Examples-for-TikTok-Video-Cover-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

It originated in the 1960s, but it was only recently that this fantastic coffee recipe got viral on TikTok. Dalgona Coffee is a mixture of water, sugar, and coffee that is whipped until the ground coffee turns caramel. The whipped coffee is then topped with iced milk, and it is ready to drink.</p><p>As 2020 began and the pandemic isolated us all in our homes, it was cooking we all turned to. Dalgona coffee is one of the top trends of that period. It all began when Korean actor Jung Il-woo shared his top-secret recipe in a program called “Stars’ Top Recipe at Fun-Staurant.” After that, many TikTokers started recreating their own version of the recipe until it became a trend.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/1-viral-tiktok-food-recipes.jpg"                      alt="dalgona coffee-viral tiktok food recipe"                ></p><h3 id="2-Accordion-Potatoes"><a href="#2-Accordion-Potatoes" class="headerlink" title="2.

While TikTok food influencers all made their own versions of the accordion potato, the fun part about this recipe is that you can easily alter it to your taste. Garnish it with salt, spices, garlic, or mayo; there are just too many versions to count.</p><p>The recipe is very easy, and even the dicing is not that difficult with numerous hacks available. Once diced, dip it into flour, fry it, and enjoy!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/03/2-viral-tiktok-food-recipes.jpg"                      alt="accordion potatoes-viral tiktok food recipe"                ></p><h3 id="3-Quesadilla-from-a-Tortilla"><a href="#3-Quesadilla-from-a-Tortilla" class="headerlink" title="3.

Sharing all the recipes with her followers, all of us were no less than entertained. One of these was the highly talked about spicy vodka pasta.</p><p>While it is almost every day a new pasta dish or a pasta hack comes out, it is tough to properly cook a good pasta dish that is infused with flavors.</p><p>This quick recipe only required a few ingredients. Supermodel Gigi Hadid added some butter, parmesan cheese, shallots, heavy cream, and vodka to create this beauty. The pasta is well worth its hype.

Pesto eggs are such a flavorful upgrade from regular eggs and an easy hack that cooks in no time.

Beat the egg whites until they are fluffy, and add them to the mixture.

The presence of users having the power to choose what to post has significantly contributed to its growth. During the first quarter, it gained 350 million downloads. Currently, it boasts of having more than 800 million active users globally. However, it continues to grow and is overtaking contemporary applications like Instagram.</p><p>TikTok is a social media platform that is easily accessible from mobile phones. Besides its easy accessibility, it is a platform where content creators reach out to the entire world by uploading short videos. Brands have utilized its features like TikTok Ads Manager to market their services. This article elaborates everything about <strong>TikTok advertising</strong>: reaching your target audience using ads.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-ads.jpg"                      alt="tiktok ads"                ></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Why does TikTok Advertising Matter?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">What are Types of TikTok Ads?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Learn from 5 Best TikTok Ad Examples?</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">How to Run Ads on TikTok?</a></p><p>05 <a href="#part5">Make Your TikTok Ads Attractive with Filmora</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-Why-does-TikTok-Advertising-Matter"><a href="#Part-1-Why-does-TikTok-Advertising-Matter" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: Why does TikTok Advertising Matter?"></a>Part 1: Why does TikTok Advertising Matter?</h2><h3 id="1-The-current-generation-dominates-the-entire-platform"><a href="#1-The-current-generation-dominates-the-entire-platform" class="headerlink" title="1. The current generation dominates the entire platform"></a>1. The current generation dominates the entire platform</h3><p>As the statement suggests, most TikTok users are teens and young adults. According to research, it is the largest population and has a considerable purchasing power of over $140 billion. Currently known as Generation Z, it also consists of the largest population in the United States and other countries in the world. These statistics imply that your business can grow when you invest in targeting this audience. Therefore, use TikTok Ads Manager to market your business here. As expected, you will collect more revenue from TikTok users.</p><h3 id="2-High-engagement-rate-on-TikTok"><a href="#2-High-engagement-rate-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="2. High engagement rate on TikTok"></a>2. High engagement rate on TikTok</h3><p>Surprisingly, TikTok has overtaken so many leading brands like Facebookregarding time spent by users. Over 70% of users in the United States and the UK spend more time on TikTok than Facebook. Advertising on TikTok always increases the engagement rate required for your business. Consequently, many companies have taken advantage of that and benefited more than they had on other platforms. Some startling facts?</p><p>Young adults’ average time on Facebook is 58.5 minutes, while TikTok consumes 1 hour and 20 minutes of their time every day. Do you know what that means? More people will encounter your products and services on TikTok than on any social media platform. The more significant number of viewers leads to a larger market to get more clients.</p><h3 id="3-Advertising-on-TikTok-gets-your-video-to-be-viewed-by-many"><a href="#3-Advertising-on-TikTok-gets-your-video-to-be-viewed-by-many" class="headerlink" title="3. Advertising on TikTok gets your video to be viewed by many"></a>3. Advertising on TikTok gets your video to be viewed by many</h3><p>A larger population retains more information obtained from videos than written information. About 93% of brands have gained many customers by using social media. Advertising your products on social media platforms allows you to reach a wider audience than other ways of communication. Most of the people are members of various social media groups. That translates to reaching a wider audience by using a single ad.</p><h3 id="4-The-numerous-ad-formats-for-TikTok-allow-more-significant-engagements"><a href="#4-The-numerous-ad-formats-for-TikTok-allow-more-significant-engagements" class="headerlink" title="4. The numerous ad formats for TikTok allow more significant engagements"></a>4. The numerous ad formats for TikTok allow more significant engagements</h3><p>TikTok comes with many TikTok advertising formats that will make you reach a wider audience. Whether they are making videos, watching the “For You” feeds, or whatever they are doing on TikTok, they will still come across your ads.</p><p>We have covered these types of advert formats below, so keep reading. If you have never used videos in marketing, give it a try and see miracles happen. Any marketing campaign that utilizes video is always powerful compared to text.</p><h3 id="5-TikTok-ads-convey-your-products-and-services-to-an-international-audience"><a href="#5-TikTok-ads-convey-your-products-and-services-to-an-international-audience" class="headerlink" title="5.TikTok ads convey your products and services to an international audience"></a>5.TikTok ads convey your products and services to an international audience</h3><p>TikTok is currently available in 170 countries, and its expansion does not seem to slow down very soon. Moreover, it has many language subtitles amounting to 70. Since most of these languages are international, there’s no reason why you should be hesitating to access a global market. It doesn’t matter whether your business is still getting on its feet. You will quickly get clients by serving them online. Slowly you will find your way out and end up surpassing the branded “marketing experts.”</p><h2 id="Part-2-What-are-Types-of-TikTok-Ads"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-Types-of-TikTok-Ads" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What are Types of TikTok Ads?"></a>Part 2: What are Types of TikTok Ads?</h2><p>We have been stressing about types of TikTok ads, and now they are. There are five TikTok ads examples that you can use to embrace your digital marketing skills.</p><p><strong>1. In-Feed Ads</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-in-feed-ads.jpg"                      alt="tiktok in feed ads"                ></p><p>These are ads that will get displayed in the recommended videos of TikTok users. Regardless of their browsing history, they will come across these ads and get anxious about the services they are making efforts to market. The better part is that TikTokers can share your ads and help you to use more negligible amounts of the hard-earned money you spend in purchasing the ads. Viewers can also comment and like your ads. Take advantage of converting those who comment and subscribe to long-term clients—usually, blending this with other marketing tactics makes it even better!</p><p>A takeaway tip- include some inspiring music to convince your customers.</p><p><strong>2. Brand Takeover ads</strong></p><p>These pop-up ads appear on the screen once the user opens the TikTok app. Usually, the ad will stay on the screen for a short time before turning into a feeds ad. Your ad will still be visible in the “For You” section. It can appear as a video or image with hyperlinks to direct the client’s interest to your webpage. It is not just about helping TikTok get backlinks but primarily promoting your business. That’s not just interesting. It’s because your work is made much easier by waiting for the client to click on the ad. Ensure that your ad is impressive enough to have a higher click-through rate. Remember that your click-through rate will determine the number of sales you get.</p><p><strong>3. Top View ads</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-top-view-ads.jpg"                      alt="tiktok top view ads"                ></p><p>These cover the first post in the “<strong>Feeds</strong>“ section for a short while. Ground shuttering sounds always accompany them to capture the audience’s attention through the TikTok marketing campaigns. As usual, everyone will always pay attention to what the sound is all about. Right? At that moment, any interested viewers will click the link in the ad, which will direct them to your landing page. That’s where they will find all that they need and might consider trying out what you offer.</p><p><strong>4. Branded hashtags ads</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-hastags-ads.jpg"                      alt="tiktok hashtags ads"                ></p><p>Branded hashtags adverts are the most common on TikTok. They will mainly involve asking someone to record a video of a specific action. For instance, they will include uploading a video of something like doing some gymnastics, performing a dance, or something of the sort. The video uploaded is always under specific hashtags.</p><p>This idea has been helpful for many content creators whereby clicking on one of the videos leads to the emergence of related videos under the same hashtag. It is a perfect way to build your brand and trust among the clients you deal with. Whenever a customer comes across a video from somebody who has used the same product, they will be automatically convinced.</p><p>Have you ever come across customer reviews on marketing brands like Amazon? That’s the same way that this technique works. The only difference is that reviews are written, while branded hashtags have hyperlinks to lead you to a video.</p><p><strong>5. Branded effects ads</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-effects-ads.jpg"                      alt="tiktok effects ads"                ></p><p>Unlike branded hashtags adverts, branded effects ads come with unique animations, including applying some filters on the ad. They last for more than a week on TikTok before changing to break the monotony of those who see them. Like your products in the market, customers will always be happy to see your new and improved products. Therefore, you will maintain the content while filter effects are changed occasionally.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Learn-from-5-Best-TikTok-Ad-Examples"><a href="#Part-3-Learn-from-5-Best-TikTok-Ad-Examples" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Learn from 5 Best TikTok Ad Examples"></a>Part 3: Learn from 5 Best TikTok Ad Examples</h2><h3 id="1-Acome"><a href="#1-Acome" class="headerlink" title="1. Acome"></a>1. Acome</h3><p>Acome is an example of an In-Feed ad. It deals with electronics, mobile phones, and exposes its products to the entire world, all the way from Indonesia. The ad created increases the visibility of the phones in the competitive marketplace. The company has acquired many clients through this online marketing technique to a more significant extent. This simple ad gained 480,000 clicks, in which 34% percent of the clicks became customers. The method works. Doesn’t it?</p><h3 id="2-Kroger"><a href="#2-Kroger" class="headerlink" title="2. Kroger"></a>2. Kroger</h3><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-ads-kroger.jpg"                      alt="tiktok ads kroger"                ></p><p>The company launched its campaign when the students were just about to report to schools. The campaign contained videos on students displaying what they had bought from the company. A hashtag also accompanied the ad to promote more services like stationery and bedding equipment necessary for students.

There are five TikTok ads examples that you can use to embrace your digital marketing skills.</p><p><strong>1. In-Feed Ads</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-in-feed-ads.jpg"                      alt="tiktok in feed ads"                ></p><p>These are ads that will get displayed in the recommended videos of TikTok users. Regardless of their browsing history, they will come across these ads and get anxious about the services they are making efforts to market. The better part is that TikTokers can share your ads and help you to use more negligible amounts of the hard-earned money you spend in purchasing the ads. Viewers can also comment and like your ads. Take advantage of converting those who comment and subscribe to long-term clients—usually, blending this with other marketing tactics makes it even better!</p><p>A takeaway tip- include some inspiring music to convince your customers.</p><p><strong>2. Brand Takeover ads</strong></p><p>These pop-up ads appear on the screen once the user opens the TikTok app. Usually, the ad will stay on the screen for a short time before turning into a feeds ad. Your ad will still be visible in the “For You” section. It can appear as a video or image with hyperlinks to direct the client’s interest to your webpage. It is not just about helping TikTok get backlinks but primarily promoting your business. That’s not just interesting. It’s because your work is made much easier by waiting for the client to click on the ad. Ensure that your ad is impressive enough to have a higher click-through rate. Remember that your click-through rate will determine the number of sales you get.</p><p><strong>3. Top View ads</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-top-view-ads.jpg"                      alt="tiktok top view ads"                ></p><p>These cover the first post in the “<strong>Feeds</strong>“ section for a short while. Ground shuttering sounds always accompany them to capture the audience’s attention through the TikTok marketing campaigns. As usual, everyone will always pay attention to what the sound is all about. Right? At that moment, any interested viewers will click the link in the ad, which will direct them to your landing page. That’s where they will find all that they need and might consider trying out what you offer.</p><p><strong>4. Branded hashtags ads</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-hastags-ads.jpg"                      alt="tiktok hashtags ads"                ></p><p>Branded hashtags adverts are the most common on TikTok. They will mainly involve asking someone to record a video of a specific action. For instance, they will include uploading a video of something like doing some gymnastics, performing a dance, or something of the sort. The video uploaded is always under specific hashtags.</p><p>This idea has been helpful for many content creators whereby clicking on one of the videos leads to the emergence of related videos under the same hashtag. It is a perfect way to build your brand and trust among the clients you deal with. Whenever a customer comes across a video from somebody who has used the same product, they will be automatically convinced.</p><p>Have you ever come across customer reviews on marketing brands like Amazon? That’s the same way that this technique works. The only difference is that reviews are written, while branded hashtags have hyperlinks to lead you to a video.</p><p><strong>5. Branded effects ads</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-effects-ads.jpg"                      alt="tiktok effects ads"                ></p><p>Unlike branded hashtags adverts, branded effects ads come with unique animations, including applying some filters on the ad. They last for more than a week on TikTok before changing to break the monotony of those who see them. Like your products in the market, customers will always be happy to see your new and improved products. Therefore, you will maintain the content while filter effects are changed occasionally.</p><h2 id="Part-3-Learn-from-5-Best-TikTok-Ad-Examples-1"><a href="#Part-3-Learn-from-5-Best-TikTok-Ad-Examples-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Learn from 5 Best TikTok Ad Examples"></a>Part 3: Learn from 5 Best TikTok Ad Examples</h2><h3 id="1-Acome-1"><a href="#1-Acome-1" class="headerlink" title="1.

Regardless of their browsing history, they will come across these ads and get anxious about the services they are making efforts to market. The better part is that TikTokers can share your ads and help you to use more negligible amounts of the hard-earned money you spend in purchasing the ads. Viewers can also comment and like your ads. Take advantage of converting those who comment and subscribe to long-term clients—usually, blending this with other marketing tactics makes it even better!</p><p>A takeaway tip- include some inspiring music to convince your customers.</p><p><strong>2. Brand Takeover ads</strong></p><p>These pop-up ads appear on the screen once the user opens the TikTok app. Usually, the ad will stay on the screen for a short time before turning into a feeds ad. Your ad will still be visible in the “For You” section. It can appear as a video or image with hyperlinks to direct the client’s interest to your webpage. It is not just about helping TikTok get backlinks but primarily promoting your business. That’s not just interesting. It’s because your work is made much easier by waiting for the client to click on the ad. Ensure that your ad is impressive enough to have a higher click-through rate. Remember that your click-through rate will determine the number of sales you get.</p><p><strong>3. Top View ads</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-top-view-ads.jpg"                      alt="tiktok top view ads"                ></p><p>These cover the first post in the “<strong>Feeds</strong>“ section for a short while. Ground shuttering sounds always accompany them to capture the audience’s attention through the TikTok marketing campaigns. As usual, everyone will always pay attention to what the sound is all about. Right? At that moment, any interested viewers will click the link in the ad, which will direct them to your landing page. That’s where they will find all that they need and might consider trying out what you offer.</p><p><strong>4. Branded hashtags ads</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-hastags-ads.jpg"                      alt="tiktok hashtags ads"                ></p><p>Branded hashtags adverts are the most common on TikTok. They will mainly involve asking someone to record a video of a specific action. For instance, they will include uploading a video of something like doing some gymnastics, performing a dance, or something of the sort. The video uploaded is always under specific hashtags.</p><p>This idea has been helpful for many content creators whereby clicking on one of the videos leads to the emergence of related videos under the same hashtag. It is a perfect way to build your brand and trust among the clients you deal with. Whenever a customer comes across a video from somebody who has used the same product, they will be automatically convinced.</p><p>Have you ever come across customer reviews on marketing brands like Amazon? That’s the same way that this technique works. The only difference is that reviews are written, while branded hashtags have hyperlinks to lead you to a video.</p><p><strong>5. Branded effects ads</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-effects-ads.jpg"                      alt="tiktok effects ads"                ></p><p>Unlike branded hashtags adverts, branded effects ads come with unique animations, including applying some filters on the ad.

Make an Intro Video on TikTok (iPhone)</h2><p>In case you are all set to create a Tiktok intro video, here are a few tips you need to follow.</p><p>• Including Audio</p><p>At the top of the screen, you will find the option ‘Sound’. This is where you can look through the music. When you are done choosing the song, decide where you would like it to start and play it when you record to sync the shots better. You can also add sound effects and voice-over.</p><p>At present, you can add one song per video inside the app. However, you always have the option to edit the videos using other apps to upload on TikTok.</p><p>In TikTok, you can work with multiple audio layers. For example, you have recorded the clip with in-camera audio, sound effect, music, and anything else you have added. The app will let you lower the camera’s audio volume while raising the music volume.</p><p>• Working with the Text</p><p>For adding title or text to the video, you have to use the Text button. This lets you choose the color, font, and size of the words. If you have used Instagram fonts, this will appear similar. Once you enter the words, choose where you would like to apply them on the screen. You can also set the time and length of the text appearing on the screen.</p><p>• Adding Effects</p><p>Effects are one of the special aspects of TikTok. There are two ways to use them, before or after recording. When you’re done recording the video, you can reverse it, speed it up, or add filters. The app also lets you apply an effect when you are recording.</p><p>Since TikTok videos are mostly viewed on smartphones, vertical orientation is the best option. However, horizontal orientation is also allowed on TikTok. <strong>The best aspect ratio will be 9:16 for TikTok videos</strong> so that they can be viewed properly on any smartphone.

Make an Intro Video on TikTok (iPhone)"></a>Section 1. Make an Intro Video on TikTok (iPhone)</h2><p>In case you are all set to create a Tiktok intro video, here are a few tips you need to follow.</p><p>• Including Audio</p><p>At the top of the screen, you will find the option ‘Sound’. This is where you can look through the music. When you are done choosing the song, decide where you would like it to start and play it when you record to sync the shots better. You can also add sound effects and voice-over.</p><p>At present, you can add one song per video inside the app. However, you always have the option to edit the videos using other apps to upload on TikTok.</p><p>In TikTok, you can work with multiple audio layers. For example, you have recorded the clip with in-camera audio, sound effect, music, and anything else you have added. The app will let you lower the camera’s audio volume while raising the music volume.</p><p>• Working with the Text</p><p>For adding title or text to the video, you have to use the Text button. This lets you choose the color, font, and size of the words. If you have used Instagram fonts, this will appear similar. Once you enter the words, choose where you would like to apply them on the screen. You can also set the time and length of the text appearing on the screen.</p><p>• Adding Effects</p><p>Effects are one of the special aspects of TikTok. There are two ways to use them, before or after recording. When you’re done recording the video, you can reverse it, speed it up, or add filters. The app also lets you apply an effect when you are recording.</p><p>Since TikTok videos are mostly viewed on smartphones, vertical orientation is the best option. However, horizontal orientation is also allowed on TikTok. <strong>The best aspect ratio will be 9:16 for TikTok videos</strong> so that they can be viewed properly on any smartphone. Last, but not least, <strong>the dimension has to be 1080 x 1920.</strong></p><h2 id="Section-2-Make-a-TikTok-Intro-Video-on-Mac-3"><a href="#Section-2-Make-a-TikTok-Intro-Video-on-Mac-3" class="headerlink" title="Section 2.

You might have imagined that you would also be famous and feature on some popular platform if you possessed these abilities.</p><p>We are going to talk about these audio effects on TikTok videos today. We’ll show you <strong>How to Change Voice on TikTok</strong> and apply voice modifications there, as well as on a popular and widely used third-party software. So, let’s get the ball rolling.</p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Voice Effect Introduction</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">Record and Add Voice TikTok</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">Available Voice Effects in TikTok</a></p><p>04 <a href="#part4">Change Voice for TikTok Videos in Capcut</a></p><p>05 <a href="#part5">Change Voice from Female to Male in Filmora for TikTok Video</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Voice-Effect"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Voice-Effect" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Voice Effect?"></a>Part 1: What is Voice Effect?</h2><p>Picture filters are widely used on Instagram and Snapchat, and we are all acquainted with them. Such filters enable us to add a subtle color change or any other type of modification to our filters. However, because TikTok is all about audio and video, you may utilize voice filters in your videos.</p><p>Speech filters are sound effects that enable us to alter our voices. It’s worth noting that users can only use the application to apply speech filters to their recorded voice. When you’re not using or uploading any recordings, you won’t utilize any voice effects.</p><p>Built-in voice effects in TikTok include chipmunk, baritone, mike, megaphone, robot, battery drain, shaking, electronic, echo, synth, elf, huge, and acoustic signals.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Record-and-Add-Voice-TikTok"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Record-and-Add-Voice-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Record and Add Voice TikTok?"></a>Part 2: How to Record and Add Voice TikTok?</h2><p>Your video must feature your voice to apply Voice Effects. You can’t utilize Voice Effects in films created with built-in themes, including audio, for example.</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> To begin recording your clip, launch TikTok and hit the <strong>+ (plus symbol)</strong> at the base.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Press the <strong>Record</strong> button, record your video as usual, and tap it again to stop or end the recording. Once you’re done recording, tick the <strong>Checkmark.</strong></p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Select <strong>Voice Effects</strong> from the drop-down menu on the upper right.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/record-tiktok-video-audio.jpg"                      alt="record tiktok video with audio"                ></p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Tap to hear every one of the effects as the window opens up from the bottom. When you wish to utilize one, pick it and move your finger away from the screen. Tap <strong>None</strong> on the far left when you don’t want to employ an voice effect.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> After that, you may add any extra effects to your movie, such as text stickers. When you’re finished, tap <strong>Next</strong>. Proceed to choose your Post choices, save the video, or touch <strong>Post</strong> as you would with any other video you’ve made.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/change-voice-effect-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="change voice effect in  tiktok "                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-Available-Voice-Effects-List-in-TikTok"><a href="#Part-3-Available-Voice-Effects-List-in-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Available Voice Effects List in TikTok"></a>Part 3: Available Voice Effects List in TikTok</h2><p>TikTok has several Voice Effects that allow you to change your voice. You may explore something entertaining because you can listen to each one before deciding to utilize it.</p><ul><li><strong>Sound waves</strong>: Synth-like in tone, but with a more digital edge.</li><li><strong>Giant:</strong> Like a large, joyful monster, heavier than baritone.</li><li><strong>Helium</strong>: Chipmunk’s voice is louder pitched.</li><li><strong>Synth</strong>: Imagine 80s music with a synthesizer added to your voice.</li><li><strong>Echo</strong>: There is an echo in every word or statement.</li><li><strong>Electronic</strong>: Your comments were accompanied by a smattering of electronic noises.</li><li><strong>Vibrato:</strong> A vibrating tone, as if your voice were trembling.</li><li><strong>Low Battery</strong>: Slow and deliberate, as though your battery is running low.</li><li><strong>Robot:</strong> You seem just like a robot, as you could expect.</li><li><strong>Megaphone</strong>: You sound as though you’re whispering into a megaphone.</li><li><strong>Mic:</strong> How you would appear if you were speaking into a real microphone.</li><li><strong>Baritone</strong>: Masculine and profound.</li><li><strong>Chipmunk</strong>: Like another one of Alvin’s Chipmunks, it’s high-pitched.</li></ul><p>Check some popular and interesting TikTok voice effects compilation.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Change-Voice-for-TikTok-Videos-in-Capcut"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Change-Voice-for-TikTok-Videos-in-Capcut" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Change Voice for TikTok Videos in Capcut?"></a>Part 4: How to Change Voice for TikTok Videos in Capcut?</h2><p>The editing capabilities in TikTok are adequate yet rudimentary. You may upload and modify existing movies and photographs or record yourself for up to three minutes.

Basically, it means your account has been banned. But, the shadow part of the term means that you won’t know about the ban.</p><p>Shadowban on TikTok is a restriction that prevents your videos from appearing on the <strong>For You</strong> page or on hashtag results. It is a situation where your visibility has been reduced or where you have been banned from the platform, without your knowledge.</p><p>The act of shadowbanning a TikTok account is an automatic process done by TikTok’s algorithm to protect other users against spam content, copyright issues, and adult content. When you get shadowbanned, you stop receiving likes, views, and traffic from the For You page. Often, shadowbans go unnoticed until another user who stumbled upon your video points it out.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban"><a href="#Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?"></a>Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?</h2><p>At the early stages of TikTok, shadowbans lasted for 24 hours. But, with the latest update in the TikTok algorithm, the length of TikTok shadowban is growing. Nowadays, a TikTok account is shadowbanned for approximately up to 2 weeks.</p><p>Within the first week, there will be a drop in your followers and so will the views. After a few days of the account shadowban being in place, you won’t be able to enter any tags or make new videos on TikTok unless they are public.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-shadowban.png"                      alt="tiktok shadowban"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?"></a>Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?</h2><p>The TikTok app doesn’t ever actually tell if you are shadowbanned. But, if you are then you can probably notice it. If you are shadowbanned, your videos will neither show up on the TikTok “For You” page nor will they appear when you search them via hashtag.</p><p>During a TikTok shadowban, your videos and content will not:</p><ul><li>be visible in the search results</li><li>be visible on the feed</li><li>receive new followers</li><li>receive likes from others</li><li>receive comments from others</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok"><a href="#Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?"></a>Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?</h2><p>TikTok has not issued any explanation on its shadowbanning techniques. However, what makes complete sense is that TikTok shadowbans its users for creating videos that violate its community guidelines.</p><p>Any video with offensive content that can harm the sentiments of people or anything that can trigger other users can attract TikTok shadowban. The app might limit the visibility of your content for reasons such as your account acting as spam or you are posting inappropriate content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shadowbanned-on-tiktok.png"                      alt="shadowbanned on tiktok"                ></p><p><strong>Spam Behavior</strong></p><p>The primary reason why a user’s TikTok account can get shadowbanned is that they behave like a spammer. Usually, new people go on a spree of liking and following people in the hope that they will like and follow back. However, TikTok might recognize this behavior as spam and consider you as a robot.</p><p>If you like more than 100 posts daily, you might want to slow down. If you follow more than 50 TikTok accounts in a day, it is best to re-evaluate that strategy.</p><p><strong>Inappropriate Content</strong></p><p>Posting videos that go against the TikTok rules and community guidelines can get you shadowbanned or permanently banned.</p><p>The following content is considered inappropriate by TikTok:</p><ul><li>hate speech</li><li>fake news</li><li>violence</li><li>nudity</li><li>drugs</li><li>copyrighted music</li></ul><p>TikTok is committed to make its platform an inclusive and safe space. So, if you have experienced a drop in views or engagement, consider reassessing your recent content.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Fix-TikTok-Shadowban-and-Get-Unshadowbanned"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Fix-TikTok-Shadowban-and-Get-Unshadowbanned" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?"></a>Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?</h2><p>Wondering about how do you get unshadowbanned on TikTok? Here’s what you can do to remove your shadowban:</p><h4 id="Uninstall-and-Reinstall-TikTok"><a href="#Uninstall-and-Reinstall-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Uninstall and Reinstall TikTok"></a>Uninstall and Reinstall TikTok</h4><p>Firstly, delete your recent video. If it doesn’t work, uninstall and then reinstall the TikTok app. Sometimes, your app might just need an update to become functional once again.</p><h4 id="Switch-to-A-Pro-Account"><a href="#Switch-to-A-Pro-Account" class="headerlink" title="Switch to A Pro Account"></a>Switch to A Pro Account</h4><p>When doing a Google search on how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok, the most common tip you’ll find is to go into the Settings of your TikTok account and tap “Switch to a Pro Account”. The reason is that making the switch will allow you to see analytics for your posts and find out how people access your videos. By doing this, you can easily monitor how far your engagement has increased or dropped.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-pro-account.jpg"                      alt="tiktok pro account"                ></p><h4 id="Delete-Offensive-Content"><a href="#Delete-Offensive-Content" class="headerlink" title="Delete Offensive Content"></a>Delete Offensive Content</h4><p>You should delete content that goes against the rules and community guidelines laid down by TikTok. After deleting inappropriate content, you have to wait for at least two weeks to get the shadowban lifted. You can refresh your device once in a while to check if you have finally managed to lift the ban.</p><h4 id="Put-TikTok-On-Hold-for-Sometime"><a href="#Put-TikTok-On-Hold-for-Sometime" class="headerlink" title="Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime"></a>Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime</h4><p>Once you have deleted offensive content, clear the cache, close your app, ensure it is updated and then take a break from TikTok for a few days. Coming back after you have cleaned up your account and taken the needed break might get you unshadowbanned on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Post-Original-Innovative-Content"><a href="#Post-Original-Innovative-Content" class="headerlink" title="Post Original, Innovative Content"></a>Post Original, Innovative Content</h4><p>When you return to posting content, you need to make sure your TikTok account doesn’t get shadowbanned again. Your account has already been flagged for something and so you need to try even harder to behave. If you go back to posting the same kind of content that got you banned in the first place, you will be booted off the stage again.</p><p>Ensure you always post original content with innovative ideas. Brainstorm new ideas with your team and come up with something new and unique. This way, you can avoid copyright infringement laws on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Know-Your-Audience-More"><a href="#Know-Your-Audience-More" class="headerlink" title="Know Your Audience More"></a>Know Your Audience More</h4><p>These days, there are many kids and minor accounts on TikTok, and maintaining a healthy environment is a part of your responsibility.

If it doesn’t work, uninstall and then reinstall the TikTok app. Sometimes, your app might just need an update to become functional once again.</p><h4 id="Switch-to-A-Pro-Account-1"><a href="#Switch-to-A-Pro-Account-1" class="headerlink" title="Switch to A Pro Account"></a>Switch to A Pro Account</h4><p>When doing a Google search on how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok, the most common tip you’ll find is to go into the Settings of your TikTok account and tap “Switch to a Pro Account”. The reason is that making the switch will allow you to see analytics for your posts and find out how people access your videos.

If you go back to posting the same kind of content that got you banned in the first place, you will be booted off the stage again.</p><p>Ensure you always post original content with innovative ideas.

Anyone can go viral and become TikTok famous by gaining more likes, lots of views, and video shares. TikTok’s algorithm can put your videos at the top of the “For You” scroll and turn you into a sensation overnight, thus skyrocketing your followers count in a matter of few days. But, did you know that TikTok removed almost 50 million videos in just 6 months because those videos violated its rules?</p><p>While this social media site can easily be your shot to fame, it can even take away your audience. Or worse, it can ban you from using the app if you do not follow its community guidelines and rules. And, if you’ve been on TikTok for a while now, chances are you’ve heard about users getting ‘shadowbanned’. It’s not unusual for users to unknowingly stop receiving likes, views, and traffic on their accounts due to <strong>TikTok shadowban</strong>.</p><p>Ever since the influx of social media, shadow banning, also known as ghost banning or stealth banning, has been around. It comes up when content has been blocked or partially blocked. Sadly, when your TikTok account is shadowbanned, it will negatively affect your reach and halt your growth. Influencers and businesses rely on social media to create a community. And when they lose a part of that community, they feel a loss of support.</p><p>Wondering what shadowbanning entails, how to determine if you’ve been shadowbanned, and <strong>how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok</strong>?

Anyone can go viral and become TikTok famous by gaining more likes, lots of views, and video shares. TikTok’s algorithm can put your videos at the top of the “For You” scroll and turn you into a sensation overnight, thus skyrocketing your followers count in a matter of few days. But, did you know that TikTok removed almost 50 million videos in just 6 months because those videos violated its rules?</p><p>While this social media site can easily be your shot to fame, it can even take away your audience. Or worse, it can ban you from using the app if you do not follow its community guidelines and rules. And, if you’ve been on TikTok for a while now, chances are you’ve heard about users getting ‘shadowbanned’. It’s not unusual for users to unknowingly stop receiving likes, views, and traffic on their accounts due to <strong>TikTok shadowban</strong>.</p><p>Ever since the influx of social media, shadow banning, also known as ghost banning or stealth banning, has been around. It comes up when content has been blocked or partially blocked. Sadly, when your TikTok account is shadowbanned, it will negatively affect your reach and halt your growth. Influencers and businesses rely on social media to create a community. And when they lose a part of that community, they feel a loss of support.</p><p>Wondering what shadowbanning entails, how to determine if you’ve been shadowbanned, and <strong>how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok</strong>?

Basically, it means your account has been banned. But, the shadow part of the term means that you won’t know about the ban.</p><p>Shadowban on TikTok is a restriction that prevents your videos from appearing on the <strong>For You</strong> page or on hashtag results. It is a situation where your visibility has been reduced or where you have been banned from the platform, without your knowledge.</p><p>The act of shadowbanning a TikTok account is an automatic process done by TikTok’s algorithm to protect other users against spam content, copyright issues, and adult content. When you get shadowbanned, you stop receiving likes, views, and traffic from the For You page. Often, shadowbans go unnoticed until another user who stumbled upon your video points it out.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?"></a>Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?</h2><p>At the early stages of TikTok, shadowbans lasted for 24 hours. But, with the latest update in the TikTok algorithm, the length of TikTok shadowban is growing. Nowadays, a TikTok account is shadowbanned for approximately up to 2 weeks.</p><p>Within the first week, there will be a drop in your followers and so will the views. After a few days of the account shadowban being in place, you won’t be able to enter any tags or make new videos on TikTok unless they are public.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-shadowban.png"                      alt="tiktok shadowban"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned-3"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?"></a>Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?</h2><p>The TikTok app doesn’t ever actually tell if you are shadowbanned. But, if you are then you can probably notice it. If you are shadowbanned, your videos will neither show up on the TikTok “For You” page nor will they appear when you search them via hashtag.</p><p>During a TikTok shadowban, your videos and content will not:</p><ul><li>be visible in the search results</li><li>be visible on the feed</li><li>receive new followers</li><li>receive likes from others</li><li>receive comments from others</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok-3"><a href="#Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?"></a>Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?</h2><p>TikTok has not issued any explanation on its shadowbanning techniques. However, what makes complete sense is that TikTok shadowbans its users for creating videos that violate its community guidelines.</p><p>Any video with offensive content that can harm the sentiments of people or anything that can trigger other users can attract TikTok shadowban. The app might limit the visibility of your content for reasons such as your account acting as spam or you are posting inappropriate content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shadowbanned-on-tiktok.png"                      alt="shadowbanned on tiktok"                ></p><p><strong>Spam Behavior</strong></p><p>The primary reason why a user’s TikTok account can get shadowbanned is that they behave like a spammer. Usually, new people go on a spree of liking and following people in the hope that they will like and follow back. However, TikTok might recognize this behavior as spam and consider you as a robot.</p><p>If you like more than 100 posts daily, you might want to slow down. If you follow more than 50 TikTok accounts in a day, it is best to re-evaluate that strategy.</p><p><strong>Inappropriate Content</strong></p><p>Posting videos that go against the TikTok rules and community guidelines can get you shadowbanned or permanently banned.</p><p>The following content is considered inappropriate by TikTok:</p><ul><li>hate speech</li><li>fake news</li><li>violence</li><li>nudity</li><li>drugs</li><li>copyrighted music</li></ul><p>TikTok is committed to make its platform an inclusive and safe space.

Here’s a handy guide on <strong>Triller vs TikTok</strong>.</p><p>On August 6, 2020, President Donald Trump announced that he would take steps to ban TikTok - the popular short-term video app from operating in the USA, unless the app’s US operations were sold to an American company. With a rising tide of uncertainties surrounding TikTok’s future in the United States, TikTokers and short-form video creators are getting drawn to rival platforms like Triller.</p><p>The Trump administration and other critics of TikTok fear that the data the app collects in its US users might end up in the hands of the Chinese government. However, TikTok has said that it stores users’ data outside China and that it would resist any attempts by Beijing to grab the information.</p><p>Amid these confidentiality concerns and an impending ban imposed by the Trump administration, more and more users are now switching to Triller. In fact, as TikTok faces uncertainties between being banned or bought in the US, rival app Triller has received a big boost and attained the No.1 spot in Apple’s US App Store.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/triller-vs-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Triller Vs Tiktok"                ></p><p>With TikTok vs. Triller going on all around, here’s a detailed insight on everything you need to know about these social video apps.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Is Triller &amp; What Is TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Who Uses Triller &amp; Tiktok?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Triller Vs TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How To Make Money On The Two Apps?</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-Is-Triller-What-Is-TikTok"><a href="#What-Is-Triller-What-Is-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="What Is Triller &amp; What Is TikTok?"></a>What Is Triller &amp; What Is TikTok?</h2><h4 id="Triller"><a href="#Triller" class="headerlink" title="Triller"></a>Triller</h4><p>Triller is an artificial intelligence-driven video app released in the year 2015, thus allowing users to film videos with music. Then, the video and music content is synced algorithmically, thus automating the editing part which users can manually do on TikTok. Users can record multiple takes of themselves and using AI, the app will compile the best clips together for creating a music video.</p><p>Triller is a music video app that’s specifically built for creators. In Triller, users can collaborate with each other, use custom or existing sounds, and filters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-triller.jpg"                      alt="What Is Triller"                ></p><h4 id="TikTok"><a href="#TikTok" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h4><p>Launched in the year 2016, TikTok served the Chinese market originally. A year later, when TikTok appeared on mobile platforms around the world, it completely swept off the internet. Owned by ByteDance - a Beijing-based internet technology company, it is a Chinese social video-sharing app.</p><p>With this app, users can record a video with their smartphone, edit the video, add music, and then upload it on the platform. It is a short-form video sharing mobile app that lets users create and share 15-second videos on any topic. Today, with more than 800 million monthly active users and 1.5 billion downloads; TikTok is one of the most popular mobile applications worldwide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="What Is Tiktok"                ></p><h2 id="Who-Uses-Triller-Tiktok"><a href="#Who-Uses-Triller-Tiktok" class="headerlink" title="Who Uses Triller &amp; Tiktok?"></a>Who Uses Triller &amp; Tiktok?</h2><p>Triller, the most popular alternative to TikTok is one of the many video-led social applications that are riding a wave of anti-TikTok sentiments. In the words of Triller co-owner Ryan Kavanaugh, “We see ourselves as the adult version of TikTok”. The target audience of this music video-sharing app is between the age group of 17 to 27. Mainly, it is popular among top streaming artists, hip hop artists, and the music industry.</p><p>On the other hand, TikTok has a strong reputation for being popular with teenagers and young adults, the GenZ. While 27% of its total users are between the age group of 13-17 years, its largest age demographics (42%) are the younger adults. So when combined, the 13-24 age group represents about 69% of the app’s user base.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-uses-triller-vs-tiktok.jpeg"                      alt="Who Uses Triller Vs Tiktok"                ></p><h2 id="Triller-Vs-TikTok-Features-Comparison-Similarities-Differences"><a href="#Triller-Vs-TikTok-Features-Comparison-Similarities-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Triller Vs TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences"></a>Triller Vs TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</h2><p>At a glance, TikTok and Triller seem to have a lot in common. These social video apps provide users with an excellent way to showcase their creativity. Both these apps allow you to edit and share videos, have an extensive music library, and allow you to share videos on other social networking apps.</p><p>But, besides the similarities, there are major differences. In fact, with the Trump administration’s concerns over TikTok, many are contemplating Triller vs. TikTok. Even though both the apps offer pretty much similar services, certain features set them apart from each other.</p><p>Here’s a handy comparison outlining the notable differences between TikTok and Triller:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Features</th><th>TikTok</th><th>Triller</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Place Of Origin</td><td>China</td><td>Los Angeles</td></tr><tr><td>Users</td><td>800 million active users, with more than 2 billion downloads</td><td>65 million active users, with more than 250m downloads</td></tr><tr><td>Discover Page</td><td>Trending hashtags, promoted ad campaigns</td><td>Leaderboards, trending hashtags, categorized genre charts, promoted ad campaigns</td></tr><tr><td>Video Duration</td><td>TikTok users can make videos of 15 seconds only</td><td>Triller users can make full music videos to whole tracks</td></tr><tr><td>Video Editing Capabilities</td><td>User-based, ability to add text in particular parts of the clips, range of speeds, effects, overlays, etc.</td><td>A.I.-based, fast motion&#x2F;slow motion, text (basic), overlays</td></tr><tr><td>Music</td><td>Only allows listening to 15-seconds of a song, only lets you use music that is ingested in the app in the videos</td><td>Only allows listen to full songs, can use music that is Triller, Spotify, or Apple Music</td></tr><tr><td>AI Deployment</td><td>Analyzes the users’ preferences and interests through engagement and displays a personalized feed to every user</td><td>Analyzes biometric movements of videos and adapts them to a song’s beat</td></tr><tr><td>Genre</td><td>TikTokers can make videos on any topic, regardless of the genre</td><td>Triller seems to favor EDM and hip-hop</td></tr><tr><td>Sharability</td><td>Can download videos to share to other social networking sites</td><td>Can download videos to share to other social networking sites</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="How-To-Make-Money-On-The-Two-Apps"><a href="#How-To-Make-Money-On-The-Two-Apps" class="headerlink" title="How To Make Money On The Two Apps?"></a>How To Make Money On The Two Apps?</h2><p>Amid Triller vs. TikTok, the hunt for the better social video platform is on.

Here’s a handy guide on <strong>Triller vs TikTok</strong>.</p><p>On August 6, 2020, President Donald Trump announced that he would take steps to ban TikTok - the popular short-term video app from operating in the USA, unless the app’s US operations were sold to an American company. With a rising tide of uncertainties surrounding TikTok’s future in the United States, TikTokers and short-form video creators are getting drawn to rival platforms like Triller.</p><p>The Trump administration and other critics of TikTok fear that the data the app collects in its US users might end up in the hands of the Chinese government. However, TikTok has said that it stores users’ data outside China and that it would resist any attempts by Beijing to grab the information.</p><p>Amid these confidentiality concerns and an impending ban imposed by the Trump administration, more and more users are now switching to Triller. In fact, as TikTok faces uncertainties between being banned or bought in the US, rival app Triller has received a big boost and attained the No.1 spot in Apple’s US App Store.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/triller-vs-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Triller Vs Tiktok"                ></p><p>With TikTok vs. Triller going on all around, here’s a detailed insight on everything you need to know about these social video apps.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Is Triller &amp; What Is TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Who Uses Triller &amp; Tiktok?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Triller Vs TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How To Make Money On The Two Apps?</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-Is-Triller-What-Is-TikTok-3"><a href="#What-Is-Triller-What-Is-TikTok-3" class="headerlink" title="What Is Triller &amp; What Is TikTok?"></a>What Is Triller &amp; What Is TikTok?</h2><h4 id="Triller-3"><a href="#Triller-3" class="headerlink" title="Triller"></a>Triller</h4><p>Triller is an artificial intelligence-driven video app released in the year 2015, thus allowing users to film videos with music.

A year later, when TikTok appeared on mobile platforms around the world, it completely swept off the internet. Owned by ByteDance - a Beijing-based internet technology company, it is a Chinese social video-sharing app.</p><p>With this app, users can record a video with their smartphone, edit the video, add music, and then upload it on the platform.

Mainly, it is popular among top streaming artists, hip hop artists, and the music industry.</p><p>On the other hand, TikTok has a strong reputation for being popular with teenagers and young adults, the GenZ.

Wondering why? Well, in comparison to Triller’s 65m, TikTok has 800 million active users. Moreover, unlike Triller that’s available only in 50 countries, TikTok is available in 155 countries.

Do you spend more time in conceptualizing the message of your video? Would you rather simplify the editing process or have greater flexibility in editing?</p><p>While TikTok features a range of editing tools to give content creators the flexibility of creating the content they want, Triller deploys AI to edit videos for the creator.

But this does not mean there is no way to make a TikTok music video. Filmora is an advanced video editor for both Mac and PC that has many features that make it a great choice for TikTok videos. We’ll walk you through the process:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First of all, make sure that the latest version of Filmora Video editor is downloaded on your computer. If you haven’t already installed it, you can easily download it from the official website of Wondershare.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, Install the application and run it on your computer.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> A window will appear on your screen where you need to select the new project option.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> In the next step, you need to select the aspect ratio. Keep in mind that by default, the aspect ratio will be 16:9, which is landscape, but since the TikTok videos are in portrait orientation, we need to select 9:16 and click ok.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, you can import the media files to your Filmora library. Just click on the file, select import media, and click on the Import media files. Now select the video files that you want to edit, and they will be imported to your Filmora Library.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Now, drag the videos from the Library and drop them to your timeline.

But this does not mean there is no way to make a TikTok music video. Filmora is an advanced video editor for both Mac and PC that has many features that make it a great choice for TikTok videos. We’ll walk you through the process:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First of all, make sure that the latest version of Filmora Video editor is downloaded on your computer. If you haven’t already installed it, you can easily download it from the official website of Wondershare.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, Install the application and run it on your computer.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> A window will appear on your screen where you need to select the new project option.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> In the next step, you need to select the aspect ratio. Keep in mind that by default, the aspect ratio will be 16:9, which is landscape, but since the TikTok videos are in portrait orientation, we need to select 9:16 and click ok.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, you can import the media files to your Filmora library. Just click on the file, select import media, and click on the Import media files. Now select the video files that you want to edit, and they will be imported to your Filmora Library.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Now, drag the videos from the Library and drop them to your timeline. Once you have the videos in your timeline, you can perform all the edits that you want to perform.</p><p><strong>Step 7:</strong> If you want to add effects to your videos, then you can explore the effects section of Filmora, where you can find hundreds of cool effects to make your videos more interesting. If you like any effect and want to apply it to your video, drag the effect and drop it on the video track in the Filmora timeline.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/tiktok-reaction-video-11.jpg"                      alt="make tiktok video with Filmora"                ></p><p><strong>Step 8:</strong> Filmora also provides you with a variety of transitions and hundreds of interesting elements and titles that you can use in your videos to make them more appealing.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/tiktok-reaction-video-12.jpg"                      alt="make tiktok video with Filmora - Transitions Elements Titles"                ></p><p><strong>Step 9:</strong> If you are making a TikTok reaction video using Filmora, then you can easily play two videos side-by-side. You need to place two different videos in two different tracks in Filmora. Then select the first video and adjust the size of the video so that it covers the half area in the preview window. Then repeat the septs to cover the other half of the preview window. By doing this, you can easily make a reaction video in just a few minutes.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/04/tiktok-reaction-video-13.jpg"                      alt="how to make tiktok video with Filmora"                ></p><p><strong>Step 10:</strong> You can add your favorite music to the background of your videos. Just import the music file to Filmora and add it to the music track in the timeline. Adjust the length of the music according to the length of the video, and it will be added to the background. You can also use the volume controls to adjust the loudness.</p><p><strong>Step 11:</strong> Once you are satisfied with your video, all you need to do is export it to your system in your desired format and share it with your audience on TikTok.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For Win 7 or later (64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Try It Free <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>For macOS 10.12 or later</p><h2 id="Final-Verdict-3"><a href="#Final-Verdict-3" class="headerlink" title="Final Verdict"></a>Final Verdict</h2><p><strong>●</strong> In short, Filmora is a fully-fledged video editor that provides you with a lot of extra features that you won’t get in the built-in editor of Tiktok. It gives you a lot of creative freedom. From adding different effects to editing and enhancing your videos, It can do it all.</p><p><strong>●</strong> The best thing about Filmora is that you can try all its features for free without paying a single penny.
