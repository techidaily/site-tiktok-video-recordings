Check out below to know more.</p><p>President Donald Trump on August 5, 2020, issued executive orders announcing that he is banning Chinese-owned TikTok from U.S. app stores. The drastic move comes months after the Trump administration first teased the idea of outlawing this immensely popular video-sharing app due to national security concerns.</p><p>U.S. officials are concerned that this Chinese-owned and operated app can potentially pass on US users’ data to the Chinese government. And, with TikTok facing uncertainty in the U.S. between being banned or bought by an American company, many predict Likee may soon surpass TikTok. This has sparked the debate of Likee vs. TikTok.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/likee-vs-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Likee Vs Tiktok"                ></p><p>With TikTok mired in uncertainty in the US, users are jumping to other video-sharing apps. The continual privacy concerns over TikTok may have opened the window for competitors such as Likee to try seizing the opportunity and take the social media throne. But, so far it hasn’t been successful in surpassing TikTok since the app is at least 50 million weekly active users behind TikTok.</p><p>Here’s a detailed insight on Likee vs. TikTok.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Who Uses Likee &amp; TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Likee vs. TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Will Likee Surpass TikTok?</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-Is-Likee-What-Is-TikTok"><a href="#What-Is-Likee-What-Is-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?"></a>What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?</h2><h4 id="Likee"><a href="#Likee" class="headerlink" title="Likee"></a>Likee</h4><p>Launched in the year 2017, Likee allows users to create short videos easily with intuitive editing tools. Formerly known as ‘Like’, this photo and video editing app give users the freedom to experiment on their videos and photos as much as they want. Just like TikTok, Likee is a social video platform that provides several fun ways to create music videos, short videos, and recreate famous scenes from movies, as well as share funny moments with followers. The app utilizes an artificial intelligence algorithm for exact content recommendations for its users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/likee.png"                      alt="Likee Features"                ></p><h4 id="TikTok"><a href="#TikTok" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h4><p>Released in September 2016, TikTok is the most popular short-form, video-sharing app. Often referred to as a “lip-syncing” app, it gives users the freedom to create and share 15-second mobile videos on any topic. It is a fun and entertaining app that has emerged as one of the biggest marketing and social networking platforms today.</p><h2 id="Who-Uses-Likee-TikTok"><a href="#Who-Uses-Likee-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Who Uses Likee &amp; TikTok?"></a>Who Uses Likee &amp; TikTok?</h2><p>Likee is one of the many social-video sharing apps that have been making waves worldwide amid the privacy concerns and the ban imposed by the Trump administration on TikTok. The app is best for older teens and young adults. The app is ideal for users who love singing and dancing. Also, the app lets users star in their own music video and then share them online.</p><p>For teenagers who understand what’s apt to post in social media, can keep negative comments in perspective, and are prepared for some mature comment, Likee provides a great deal of entertainment and opportunities to show off creativity. The app has a 17+ age restriction.</p><p>Just like Likee, teenagers and younger people are the main users of TikTok. It is used by GenZ as a platform to express their creativity. According to GlobalWebIndex, about 41% of TikTok’s users are of the age group 16 to 24. A majority of TikTok’s users are content creators who wish to expand their reach through short videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-uses-likee-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Who Uses Likee Tiktok"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134248/18498" target="_top" id="2134248">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134248" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134248/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2118319/7443" target="_top" id="2118319">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2118319" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2118319/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Likee-vs-TikTok-Features-Comparison-Similarities-Differences"><a href="#Likee-vs-TikTok-Features-Comparison-Similarities-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Likee vs. TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences"></a>Likee vs. TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</h2><p>Ever since its launch in 2016, TikTok has been growing in popularity all over the world. It is a social platform for sharing short videos. As with Likee, it is the perfect tool for creating the most amazing multimedia content that you can think of.</p><p>Both these apps are used for creating and sharing short videos on social media and are compatible with Android as well as iOS devices. Each of these apps offers a range of attractions for their young users.</p><p>With people debating on whether to stick with TikTok or switch to Likee, are you confused about what sets apart these video-sharing apps from each other? Here’s a detailed comparison of Likee vs. TikTok.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Features</th><th>TikTok</th><th>Likee</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Headquarters</td><td>China</td><td>Singapore</td></tr><tr><td>Platform Type</td><td>TikTok is a PGC (Profession Generated Content) platform</td><td>Likee is a UGC (User Generated Content) platform</td></tr><tr><td>Video Editing Options</td><td>A multitude of video effects Emojis, text, frames, trimming videos, and much more</td><td>AI &amp; AR-based technology Realistic hair color filters, 4D magic, superpower effects</td></tr><tr><td>Music Options</td><td>Broad and up-to-date music catalog. Third-party apps are needed to add their own music</td><td>The built-in music library is fairly limited to TikTok. Allows users to add ‘local music’</td></tr><tr><td>Text Options</td><td>Text boxes with accurate timing and positioning. The background color is adjustable</td><td>Multiple text boxes with accurate timing. Ability to change the size, font, color, angle, and background</td></tr><tr><td>Socialization</td><td>TikTok aims to redefine digital socialization by introducing online video socialization</td><td>Likee allows user to watch live streaming and make new friends by People Nearby function</td></tr><tr><td>Users</td><td>800 million active users worldwide</td><td>150 million monthly active users</td></tr></tbody></table><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1948881/19272" target="_top" id="1948881">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1948881" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1948881/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Will-Likee-Surpass-TikTok"><a href="#Will-Likee-Surpass-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Will Likee Surpass TikTok?"></a>Will Likee Surpass TikTok?</h2><p>With the whole “TikTok being banned in the US” becoming a thing, some assumed that competitors will soon surpass TikTok. However, no competitor, including Likee has been successful in doing so. Although some users switched to other video-sharing apps in panic, TikTok remains to be in the spotlight even today. Moreover, after a deal was sealed with Walmart and Oracle, it appears that TikTok will be able to continue its operations in the U.S.</p><p>Whether TikTok is really a national security concern remains unclear. But, one thing is clear - just like TikTok, Likee isn’t protected from scrutiny over apps with Chinese roots. Likee is owned by a company based in Singapore which in turn was purchased by China’s JOYI. Moreover, with India already ousting Likee along with other Chinese apps for being a threat to national security, the Trump administration isn’t far behind.</p><p>Listed below are a few major reasons TikTok will maintain its top spot and popularity amid all privacy concerns for the years to come.</p><h4 id="1-TikTok-Is-Highly-Addictive"><a href="#1-TikTok-Is-Highly-Addictive" class="headerlink" title="1.TikTok Is Highly Addictive"></a>1.TikTok Is Highly Addictive</h4><p>People on Facebook and Instagram might know that time flies by once they start scrolling through the news feed. But, TikTok is much more addictive than Facebook and Instagram. People on TikTok spend 55 minutes on the app on average. This is very interesting since it depicts the great potential for marketers.</p><p>Mostly, TikTok users spend their time in binge-watching videos. What makes TikTok so addictive is that the app enables users to express themselves through different creative ways.</p><h4 id="2-Native-Content-Editor"><a href="#2-Native-Content-Editor" class="headerlink" title="2.Native Content Editor"></a>2.Native Content Editor</h4><p>TikTok’s features to shoot footage, quickly trim and stitch together video clips and incorporate voice as well as music effects at the touch of a button makes it the ideal destination for every creator. When it comes to Likee vs. TikTok, what makes the trim feature of TikTok so enticing is that the app allows creators to storyboard their videos and publish their finished product.</p><h4 id="3-Its-Feed-Is-Wired-For-Viral-Videos"><a href="#3-Its-Feed-Is-Wired-For-Viral-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3.Its Feed Is Wired For Viral Videos"></a>3.Its Feed Is Wired For Viral Videos</h4><p>The homepage of TikTok is much more like Twitter than Instagram or Facebook. This means that viral videos with great engagement move to the front of the line and comprise the feed. Although a “Discover” tab allows you to browse specific topics and hashtags, you are served with one video at a time.</p><p>This is a part of TikTok’s competitive advantage over Likee. With an endless number of prompts, it is easy to participate since you need not have anything interesting to talk about to get started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-problem.jpg"                      alt="Tiktok Problem"                ></p><p>source：<a class="link"   href="http://www.theguardian.com/" >www.theguardian.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2137393/7443" target="_top" id="2137393">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2137393" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2137393/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>No matter whether you are social media lurker or a content creator, be assured that TikTok is here to stay. Don’t believe us? Try Likee for yourself and you will soon realize that TikTok is unmatchable. In fact, with a constant surge in popularity of TikTok, it is all set to become the biggest video-sharing app ever. So with that being said, do you really think Likee can surpass TikTok?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-igtvs-top-picks-for-next-weeks-feed/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved IGTV's Top Picks for Next Week's Feed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-jpegpng-to-pdf-on-iphone-step-by-step-approach/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved JPEG/PNG to PDF on iPhone - Step-by-Step Approach</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-mastering-live-participation-stepping-into-others-tiktok-sessions/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Mastering Live Participation Stepping Into Others' TikTok Sessions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-ultimate-pc-guide-to-starting-live-on-tiktok/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Ultimate PC Guide to Starting Live on TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-decoding-tiktoks-use-of-pfp-what-does-it-stand-for/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Decoding TikTok’s Use of 'PFP' What Does It Stand For?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-become-an-elite-joiner-tips-for-tiktok-lives-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Become an Elite Joiner Tips for TikTok Lives for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-top-10-gamer-vloggers-on-tiktok-today/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Top 10 Gamer Vloggers on TikTok Today</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-unlock-the-full-power-of-apples-siri-with-integrated-voice-control-on-tiktok/"><u>[Updated] Unlock the Full Power of Apple's Siri with Integrated Voice Control on TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-recovery.techidaily.com/discover-apples-latest-charismatic-gadgets-released-silently-last-week-insights/"><u>Discover Apple’s Latest Charismatic Gadgets Released Silently Last Week - Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/discover-the-power-of-personalized-vocal-effects-in-tiktok-videos/"><u>Discover the Power of Personalized Vocal Effects in TikTok Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://hardware-updates.techidaily.com/get-instant-access-to-updated-dolby-sound-drivers-compatible-with-windows-111081/"><u>Get Instant Access to Updated Dolby Sound Drivers Compatible with Windows 11/10/8.1</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-hub.techidaily.com/hassle-free-adb-driver-installation-process-on-windows-systems/"><u>Hassle-Free ADB Driver Installation Process on Windows Systems</u></a></li><li><a href="https://blog-min.techidaily.com/how-to-recover-deleted-pictures-from-infinix-note-30i-by-fonelab-android-recover-pictures/"><u>How to recover deleted pictures from Infinix Note 30i.</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/journey-into-the-enigma-discovering-hidden-emoji-messages/"><u>Journey Into the Enigma Discovering Hidden Emoji Messages</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-amazing.techidaily.com/movavi-3gpp-mpeg/"><u>Movavi의 가격이나 요구사항 없이 온라인에서 3GPP MPEG 변환하기</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/quali-sono-i-lettori-video-video-in-4k-ultra-hd-migliori-raccomandazioni-per-pc-e-mac-con-prova-gratis-e-valutazioni-autentiche/"><u>Quali Sono I Lettori Video Video in 4K Ultra HD Migliori?

These factors include views count and their authenticity, number of engagement, the region where the views come from, and total followers compared to likes. Performance on this social media platform is dynamic as it changes naturally. Besides, the daily funding amount can differ depending on the number of videos released on that day. So, the specific amount differs from one person to another.</p><p>Now that you have an idea of the creator fund payout, you might be wondering about top TikTok creators who have monetized their content. Here’s a list of TikTok’s 5 highest paid TikTokers based on Forbes’ list of the highest-earning stars in 2020:</p><h3 id="1-Addison-Rae-Easterling"><a href="#1-Addison-Rae-Easterling" class="headerlink" title="1.Addison Rae Easterling"></a>1.Addison Rae Easterling</h3><p>Louisiana-native Addison Rae is TikTok’s top-earning star who earns $5 million in just a year.

For example, if you start your streak on your birthday, you’ll always remember to keep the streak going on, and it will also help you to grab the attention of people.</p><p><strong>Idea 2. Memorable Day</strong></p><p>We all have memorable days in our lives, like a milestone, graduation, or special event that we want to remember forever. What is a better way to commemorate them than with a Snap? Your friends and family will appreciate it, and you will be able to keep your streak alive for days to come.</p><p><strong>Idea 3. Streak While Traveling</strong></p><p>Whenever you are on a trip, travel to your office&#x2F;college, or head out to run some errands, remember to take a picture of the surroundings that look interesting and send it to whom you are establishing the streak.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snapstreak-while-traveling.jpg"                      alt="send snapstreak while traveling"                ></p><h3 id="Tip-3-Organize-Your-Snapchat-And-Your-Time"><a href="#Tip-3-Organize-Your-Snapchat-And-Your-Time" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3. Organize Your Snapchat And Your Time"></a>Tip 3. Organize Your Snapchat And Your Time</h3><p>Are you trying to get the most out of Snapchat without letting it take over your life? Below we’ve provided some ideas to help you organize your time and your snaps.</p><p><strong>Idea 1. Edit the Name of your Snapchat Friends</strong></p><p>To avoid losing your Snapchat streaks with any of your contacts, you should start editing their names. Snapchat lists your most contacted friends at the top, so you might not see the others who are lower on your list. Editing their names to include something that will help you search for them will make it easier to avoid forgetting to send them a snap regularly.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/edit-the-name-of-your-snapchat-friend.jpg"                      alt="edit the name of your snapchat friend"                ></p><p><strong>Idea 2. Pin Your Conversations</strong></p><p>If you want to keep someone at the top of your chat list, consider pinning their chat. This will also ultimately help you send snaps to them without breaking the streak.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/pin-conversation-in-snapchat.jpg"                      alt="pin conversation in snapchat"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://united.elfm.net/c/5597632/517826/4704" target="_top" id="517826">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/4704-517826" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://united.elfm.net/i/5597632/517826/4704"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Idea 3. Stick to a Particular Time of the Day</strong></p><p>You will gain more by starting your Snapstreaks later on in the day, especially if you are only sending one snap per day. This way, the hourglass emoji will be visible for a considerable amount of time before it expires.</p><p><strong>Idea 4. Check Your Filters</strong></p><p>If you’re trying to keep up with multiple Snapstreaks at once, it’s easy to forget who you’re on a streak with. But there’s a way to see them without going to your list of friends.</p><p>Whenever you’re about to send a new snap, swipe through the filters. Here, you’ll see a special Snapchat streak filter, which will show how many consecutive days of successful streak you have in big white numbers next to the fire emoji.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2047411/19272" target="_top" id="2047411">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2047411" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2047411/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h2><p>In this article, we’ve compiled a list of fun and creative <strong>Snapchat streak ideas</strong> to help you stay connected with your friends.</p><p>Hopefully, by following these tips, you can now keep your Snapchat streak alive and stay connected with your contacts in a better and more engaging way!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For Win 7 or later(64-bit)</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Free Download <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> For macOS 10.14 or later</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2043603/7443" target="_top" id="2043603">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2043603" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2043603/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Streamlining-Your-Archive-Converting-Snapchat’s-Ephemeral-Snaps"><a href="#Streamlining-Your-Archive-Converting-Snapchat’s-Ephemeral-Snaps" class="headerlink" title="Streamlining Your Archive: Converting Snapchat’s Ephemeral Snaps"></a>Streamlining Your Archive: Converting Snapchat’s Ephemeral Snaps</h2><p>Snapchat is the most popular social media platform that is enjoyed by youngsters.

At the moment TikTok is one of the best video sharing platforms for aspiring music video producers because it has more than 500 million active monthly users.</p><p>While joining the TikTok’s community and creating your own account is a simple process, deleting an account is a bit more complicated.

However, the recent introduction of the <strong>‘Thinking about removing your account’</strong> option has made this task much quicker. Here’s how you can delete a TikTok account permanently in just a few easy steps.</p><h4 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h4><p>You must first <strong>add a phone number</strong> to a TikTok account before you can proceed to delete it.

Choose the <strong>Manage my Account</strong> option from the Settings menu, then locate the <strong>Phone Number feature</strong> and tap on it to insert your phone number. The app will send a <strong>one-time password (OTP)</strong> to your phone, so you just have to enter the <strong>verification code</strong> into the appropriate box, and your phone will be connected to your TikTok account.</p><h4 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h4><p>Afterward, you should once again tap on the <strong>Profile Information</strong> icon in the lower right corner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-tiktok-account-1.jpg"                      alt="delete TikTok account "                ></p><p>Once the new window opens, hit the <strong>Settings icon.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-to-delete-tiktok-account-2.jpg"                      alt="delete TikTok account "                ></p><p>A pop-up menu will appear on the screen, proceed to select the <strong>Privacy and Settings</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-tiktok-account-permanently-3.jpg"                      alt="delete TikTok account "                ></p><p>The <strong>Privacy and Settings</strong> dialogue box will appear on the screen and you should tap on the <strong>Manage My Account</strong> option, which is located at the top of the list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-tiktok-account-4.jpg"                      alt="delete TikTok account "                ></p><p>Locate the <strong>Thinking about removing your account</strong> feature, then tap on it and the app will send an OTP message to your phone automatically.</p><h4 id="Step-3"><a href="#Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h4><p>Insert the <strong>verification code</strong> you received in the OTP message into the appropriate box and hit the <strong>Continue button</strong> to complete the process of deleting your TikTok account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-tiktok-account-permanently-5.jpg"                      alt="delete TikTok account "                ></p><p>Keep in mind that your account cannot be recovered once it is deleted and that all information that wasn’t saved on it such as chat messages is going to remain visible to other users of the TikTok platform after you deactivate your account.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087389/7443" target="_top" id="2087389">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087389" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087389/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Think-Twice-Before-Deleting-Your-Account"><a href="#Think-Twice-Before-Deleting-Your-Account" class="headerlink" title="Think Twice Before Deleting Your Account"></a>Think Twice Before Deleting Your Account</h2><p>If you don’t want to lose all the videos you shared on TikTok you should download them from your profile to your phone because all the data that was stored on your account is going to be deleted.

Create Your TikTok Pixel and Events</strong></p><p>TikTok has an events manager tool to run TikTok ad campaigns that allow you to track activities and app events on your website, just as other social channels use a piece of code. The TikTok pixel integrates well with Google Tag Manager and Shopify. An option is also available to manually install the pixel in your website’s header.</p><p>Once the base code of pixel installs on your site, you will get prompted to set the event rules using either Developer Mode or Standard Mode. You can select any above methods based on your conversion and business path.</p><p><strong>2. Craft Custom Audiences and Create Lookalikes from Them</strong></p><p>Take a second to make custom audiences depending upon app or website activity and your customer lists once your pixel installs. After that, develop lookalikes of those audiences.</p><p>The similar will come in handy when you’re making target audiences for such campaigns, and you’ll be able to eliminate some of your groups of ads to allow better waste management.</p><p><strong>3. Create Target Audiences that Aren’t Too Small</strong></p><p>There are around 80 million TikTok users in the U.S. That’s a considerable number, though!</p><p>On TikTok, those same targeting parameters would yield an audience size of 35K monthly active users. So, you need to focus on a pretty large target audience and create a niche around them.</p><p><strong>4. Develop Video Ads Made with TikTok Trends in Mind</strong></p><p>You’re interrupting someone’s feed with a brand ad that the user didn’t ask for but got anyway. Your content should be captivating, designed with TikTok consumption in mind, and concise.</p><p><strong>5.

Anyone can go viral and become TikTok famous by gaining more likes, lots of views, and video shares. TikTok’s algorithm can put your videos at the top of the “For You” scroll and turn you into a sensation overnight, thus skyrocketing your followers count in a matter of few days. But, did you know that TikTok removed almost 50 million videos in just 6 months because those videos violated its rules?</p><p>While this social media site can easily be your shot to fame, it can even take away your audience. Or worse, it can ban you from using the app if you do not follow its community guidelines and rules. And, if you’ve been on TikTok for a while now, chances are you’ve heard about users getting ‘shadowbanned’. It’s not unusual for users to unknowingly stop receiving likes, views, and traffic on their accounts due to <strong>TikTok shadowban</strong>.</p><p>Ever since the influx of social media, shadow banning, also known as ghost banning or stealth banning, has been around. It comes up when content has been blocked or partially blocked. Sadly, when your TikTok account is shadowbanned, it will negatively affect your reach and halt your growth. Influencers and businesses rely on social media to create a community. And when they lose a part of that community, they feel a loss of support.</p><p>Wondering what shadowbanning entails, how to determine if you’ve been shadowbanned, and <strong>how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok</strong>? Check out below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

Basically, it means your account has been banned. But, the shadow part of the term means that you won’t know about the ban.</p><p>Shadowban on TikTok is a restriction that prevents your videos from appearing on the <strong>For You</strong> page or on hashtag results. It is a situation where your visibility has been reduced or where you have been banned from the platform, without your knowledge.</p><p>The act of shadowbanning a TikTok account is an automatic process done by TikTok’s algorithm to protect other users against spam content, copyright issues, and adult content. When you get shadowbanned, you stop receiving likes, views, and traffic from the For You page. Often, shadowbans go unnoticed until another user who stumbled upon your video points it out.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban"><a href="#Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?"></a>Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?</h2><p>At the early stages of TikTok, shadowbans lasted for 24 hours. But, with the latest update in the TikTok algorithm, the length of TikTok shadowban is growing. Nowadays, a TikTok account is shadowbanned for approximately up to 2 weeks.</p><p>Within the first week, there will be a drop in your followers and so will the views. After a few days of the account shadowban being in place, you won’t be able to enter any tags or make new videos on TikTok unless they are public.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-shadowban.png"                      alt="tiktok shadowban"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?"></a>Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?</h2><p>The TikTok app doesn’t ever actually tell if you are shadowbanned. But, if you are then you can probably notice it. If you are shadowbanned, your videos will neither show up on the TikTok “For You” page nor will they appear when you search them via hashtag.</p><p>During a TikTok shadowban, your videos and content will not:</p><ul><li>be visible in the search results</li><li>be visible on the feed</li><li>receive new followers</li><li>receive likes from others</li><li>receive comments from others</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok"><a href="#Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?"></a>Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?</h2><p>TikTok has not issued any explanation on its shadowbanning techniques. However, what makes complete sense is that TikTok shadowbans its users for creating videos that violate its community guidelines.</p><p>Any video with offensive content that can harm the sentiments of people or anything that can trigger other users can attract TikTok shadowban. The app might limit the visibility of your content for reasons such as your account acting as spam or you are posting inappropriate content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shadowbanned-on-tiktok.png"                      alt="shadowbanned on tiktok"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2148774/18498" target="_top" id="2148774">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2148774" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2148774/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p><strong>Spam Behavior</strong></p><p>The primary reason why a user’s TikTok account can get shadowbanned is that they behave like a spammer. Usually, new people go on a spree of liking and following people in the hope that they will like and follow back. However, TikTok might recognize this behavior as spam and consider you as a robot.</p><p>If you like more than 100 posts daily, you might want to slow down. If you follow more than 50 TikTok accounts in a day, it is best to re-evaluate that strategy.</p><p><strong>Inappropriate Content</strong></p><p>Posting videos that go against the TikTok rules and community guidelines can get you shadowbanned or permanently banned.</p><p>The following content is considered inappropriate by TikTok:</p><ul><li>hate speech</li><li>fake news</li><li>violence</li><li>nudity</li><li>drugs</li><li>copyrighted music</li></ul><p>TikTok is committed to make its platform an inclusive and safe space. So, if you have experienced a drop in views or engagement, consider reassessing your recent content.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1915805/19272" target="_top" id="1915805">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1915805" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1915805/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Fix-TikTok-Shadowban-and-Get-Unshadowbanned"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Fix-TikTok-Shadowban-and-Get-Unshadowbanned" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?"></a>Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?</h2><p>Wondering about how do you get unshadowbanned on TikTok? Here’s what you can do to remove your shadowban:</p><h4 id="Uninstall-and-Reinstall-TikTok"><a href="#Uninstall-and-Reinstall-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Uninstall and Reinstall TikTok"></a>Uninstall and Reinstall TikTok</h4><p>Firstly, delete your recent video. If it doesn’t work, uninstall and then reinstall the TikTok app. Sometimes, your app might just need an update to become functional once again.</p><h4 id="Switch-to-A-Pro-Account"><a href="#Switch-to-A-Pro-Account" class="headerlink" title="Switch to A Pro Account"></a>Switch to A Pro Account</h4><p>When doing a Google search on how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok, the most common tip you’ll find is to go into the Settings of your TikTok account and tap “Switch to a Pro Account”. The reason is that making the switch will allow you to see analytics for your posts and find out how people access your videos. By doing this, you can easily monitor how far your engagement has increased or dropped.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-pro-account.jpg"                      alt="tiktok pro account"                ></p><h4 id="Delete-Offensive-Content"><a href="#Delete-Offensive-Content" class="headerlink" title="Delete Offensive Content"></a>Delete Offensive Content</h4><p>You should delete content that goes against the rules and community guidelines laid down by TikTok. After deleting inappropriate content, you have to wait for at least two weeks to get the shadowban lifted. You can refresh your device once in a while to check if you have finally managed to lift the ban.</p><h4 id="Put-TikTok-On-Hold-for-Sometime"><a href="#Put-TikTok-On-Hold-for-Sometime" class="headerlink" title="Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime"></a>Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime</h4><p>Once you have deleted offensive content, clear the cache, close your app, ensure it is updated and then take a break from TikTok for a few days. Coming back after you have cleaned up your account and taken the needed break might get you unshadowbanned on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Post-Original-Innovative-Content"><a href="#Post-Original-Innovative-Content" class="headerlink" title="Post Original, Innovative Content"></a>Post Original, Innovative Content</h4><p>When you return to posting content, you need to make sure your TikTok account doesn’t get shadowbanned again. Your account has already been flagged for something and so you need to try even harder to behave. If you go back to posting the same kind of content that got you banned in the first place, you will be booted off the stage again.</p><p>Ensure you always post original content with innovative ideas.

TikTok now seems to be a part of everyone’s life through the most popular lip-syncing videos, one-act dance routines, 1-min recipes, funny clips, and stuff like the bottle cap challenge.</p><p>More or less the heart and soul of today’s teenagers and young adults, and sometimes even senior citizens, TikTok now has over 1 billion users and became the World’s 7th most downloaded app, all within a span of 3years since its release in 2016.</p><p>What started with fun and games has become a serious platform to showcase one’s talent and gain followers, earn money, and even stardom. Such provisions have stirred fierce competition among influencers, for what seems like the Wars of Creativity to publish more and more viral-worthy videos.</p><p>If you are an influencer looking for new and amazing <strong>TikTok ideas</strong> to make your videos go viral, then here is a stimulus.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: TikTok vs YouTube</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers</a></li></ul><h2 id="TikTok-vs-YouTube"><a href="#TikTok-vs-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="TikTok vs YouTube"></a>TikTok vs YouTube</h2><p>TikTok may be one of a kind, but it is not the only platform where you can publish your mobile-made videos without much ado. The protagonist of that story is still, YouTube. TikTok being a game-changer in the scene, is giving maximum competition to all other social networks and digital platforms that deal with video-sharing, such as Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook. But the tiff between YouTube and TikTok surpasses all other competitions because only these two are all about Videos.</p><h4 id="Nature-of-Content"><a href="#Nature-of-Content" class="headerlink" title="Nature of Content"></a>Nature of Content</h4><p>The main difference between YouTube and TikTok is the nature of the content. YouTube is a broader spectrum than TikTok, for it contains feature-length movies, episodes of off-air Television Series, music videos, podcasts, and personal videos is just a part of it. But TikTok revolves around short video clips. And just that.</p><h4 id="User-Base"><a href="#User-Base" class="headerlink" title="User Base"></a>User Base</h4><p>TikTok has a niche user base, with the majority of users between 16 and 25 yo. Meanwhile, YouTube reserves a universal user base, catering to people of all ages and from different walks of life.</p><h4 id="Outreach"><a href="#Outreach" class="headerlink" title="Outreach"></a>Outreach</h4><p>TikTok is primarily a casual, youth-centric platform. While it is useful for highlighting one’s talent and engaging a loyal fanbase, it is not ideal for business promotion, or to present a show in a traditional way, which is a substantial offering of YouTube. But on the flip side, due to the vastness of YouTube, short and casual videos like the ones typically available in TikTok, have limited scope to go viral.</p><p>Therefore, the difference between TikTok and YouTube is like Apples and Oranges. They are both fruits and are sweet. But are different species with different tastes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1424529">                    <video width="864" height="1536" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424529.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16446-1424529">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1424529.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:540px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Flaganoo.pxf.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1424529%2F16446'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1424529/16446"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Top-10-TikTok-Video-Ideas-to-Boost-More-Followers"><a href="#Top-10-TikTok-Video-Ideas-to-Boost-More-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers"></a>Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers</h2><h4 id="1-Music-Videos"><a href="#1-Music-Videos" class="headerlink" title="1. Music Videos"></a>1. Music Videos</h4><p>A common theme of most viral TikTok videos is they tend to be cute and cuddly. As part of music videos, you are required to imitate certain adorable songs by performing their actions either using your hands or by putting your whole body into action. These songs can be typically found in the trending section of the app and it does not take much effort to figure out the ones that are high in popularity. The catch here is that you need to be among the frontrunners in terms of covering these songs so that you can find yourself a large captive audience to influence at the earliest.</p><p>Here is an example of <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsPbFnhZQ/" >a girl showing off her TikTok music video skills <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="2-Dance-Videos"><a href="#2-Dance-Videos" class="headerlink" title="2. Dance Videos"></a>2. Dance Videos</h4><p>If it is short, funny, and uses the correct hashtags, your dance video can create a lot of influence among your followers. Oh, and don’t forget to pair them up with the correct background score. A song that is already trending and popular on the social platform will only boost your video’s chances of a hit. A short and easy dance always does the business, even better if it can be used for a meme.</p><p>This is a good example of what <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsN-RFmQn/" >your dance video should look like <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Now isn’t that the perfect ingredient for the next viral meme on the market!</p><h4 id="3-Calming-Videos"><a href="#3-Calming-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Calming Videos"></a>3. Calming Videos</h4><p>Just because it’s a TikTok video doesn’t mean that it has to be over-the-top and loud. Sometimes, keeping things simple is the secret to success. Calming videos are those where something that most would otherwise consider weird or mundane exerts a feeling of calm on the viewer. Most social media platforms have helped such videos gain immense popularity but finding the right explanation of what these pertain to is a pretty difficult task.</p><p>Look at this video of <a class="link"   href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/705446729114378862/" >color droplets being sprayed from the tip of a brush <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Did that not calm your mind?</p><h4 id="4-Objects-Singing-Videos"><a href="#4-Objects-Singing-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4. Objects Singing Videos"></a>4. Objects Singing Videos</h4><p>One of the viral TikTok memes had several objects singing Adele’s hit number “ Someone Like You”. This could be something for you to base your ideas on for a new viral video. Use any object around the house, not even necessary that it should move about. The trick lies in finding the right song to pair with, something that will lend a soul to the object and give the impression of the performance coming from a real person.</p><p>See if <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1079418894538940418" >Pikachu and his orchestra can provide you with some inspiration <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="5-Art-Videos"><a href="#5-Art-Videos" class="headerlink" title="5. Art Videos"></a>5. Art Videos</h4><p>This one is for all the artists out there. If you are someone who creates figurines, pictures, or any other form of art, then don’t let your creative process go unnoticed – rather, film it and put it up as a Tik Tok video. The social media platform has many takers for such videos that show the process behind every creative job as it helps give a view into the thought process of an artist, however minute. This is also a good way for you to promote your work on social media, helping you gain greater exposure in the long run. Add some creative twists to these videos and help them stand out in the crowd.</p><p>Here is someone <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BxvZ78YHEUf/" >showing off their artistic skills <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="6-1-Minute-Recipes"><a href="#6-1-Minute-Recipes" class="headerlink" title="6.1-Minute Recipes"></a>6.1-Minute Recipes</h4><p>If you are a cooking aficionado and often dabble around in the kitchen for preparing new recipes, then TikTok is a good place to share your cooking videos. While fitting in the entire video into a matter of a few seconds can prove difficult, it is certainly not impossible. Skip the commentary and speed up the videos but make sure they are of self-explanatory nature. If cooking is not your thing, you can also post videos of what you eat every day – there is a sizable follower base for that category as well!</p><p>Chef Shereen will show you <a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cookingwithshereen/video/6841303083289464070" >how to cook a Santa Claus Melon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> here</p><h4 id="7-Animal-Videos"><a href="#7-Animal-Videos" class="headerlink" title="7. Animal Videos"></a>7. Animal Videos</h4><p>Oh, those amazing creations of the Almighty! When it comes to cute pet clips, there is very little you can go wrong with. Be it tricks, reaction to your singing, or simply them having a jolly good time, there is always a lot of attention on pets. If you have not done so already, it is time to capture the acts of your pets on camera and start pulling in the followers. The music needs to be as adorable as the pets themselves and make sure they are at ease doing what you ask them to do. The more authentic the reaction, the more attention your video will get. Use the shots where you get the sincerest reactions to come up with the most interesting clips.</p><p>Just look at this <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzLCv72DpcY/" >adorable little doggo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="8-Funny-TikTok-Ideas"><a href="#8-Funny-TikTok-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="8. Funny TikTok Ideas"></a>8. Funny TikTok Ideas</h4><p>Narrate funny stories with your twist in the narrative, few sources of entertainment can be as good!

For iPhone users, Siri is not new. Siri helps them read text messages and much more, but soon after the text-to-speech feature was added in TikTok, it took the TikTokers world by storm. But since the voice sounded so much like Siri, people started calling it Siri voice rather than text-to-speech. This feature allows users to convert any text into a speech using an automated voice. And if you have never used the text-to-speech feature, this post will help you understand <strong>how to do the Siri voice on TikTok.</strong></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is Siri Voice?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">TikTok Voice Changer Apps</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Siri-Voice"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Siri-Voice" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Siri Voice?"></a>Part 1: What is Siri Voice?</h2><p>Siri voice in TikTok is basically an automated voice feature where the voice reads out the text on the video. The feature is called text-to-speech. So, whenever you enable it on your video, the text will be read out loud, which makes the video watching experience fun. Therefore, those who want to add a voice to their TikTok videos can use the text-to-speech feature and let the automated voice do that talking.</p><p>You will find almost everyone using it, even those who often use their voice in TikTok videos, and that’s because many TikTok users find it entertaining and funny. Well, no matter why you want to use this feature, find out <strong>how to do Siri voice on TikTok</strong> without any hassle in the next part!</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Do-Siri-Voice-on-TikTok"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Do-Siri-Voice-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?"></a>Part 2: How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?</h2><p>To do Siri voice on TikTok, you will have to follow just a few simple steps. Here are the steps that you need to take care of:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch TikTok on your mobile phone.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start recording a video; else, upload an already recorded video.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap the Upload button and then click on the checkmark.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, begin writing something on the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Tap on the text you have just written, and you will see the Text-to-Speech option.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Click on that and hear the automated voice reading your text.

Try These TikTok Voice Changer Apps</h2><p>If you are not impressed with the Siri voice on TikTok and would instead like to use some other fun and peppy voice for the text, the good news is there are tons of apps that can help you do that. But before we share the names of the apps, let’s throw some light on why people are looking for such apps. First, if you are using TikTok’s text-to-speech feature in North America, you will hear a computer-automated female voice who will read out the text of the video.</p><p>But, when it comes to the UK, the app uses a computer-generated male voice with a rockin’ accent instead of a female voice. However, recently the voiceover artist of the female voice has filed a lawsuit against the company, saying that she never permitted TikTok to use her voice for text-to-speech, which is why TikTok is now using a cheerful valley girl voice for the text-to-speech feature. Unfortunately, TikTok users are not happy with the new voice, making them look for the best TikTok voice generator apps.</p><p>If you also want to add another voice for the text-to-speech, here are our hand-picked top and best 5 TikTok voice generator apps for iOS and Android.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123733/7443" target="_top" id="2123733">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2123733" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2123733/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Voice-Changer"><a href="#1-Voice-Changer" class="headerlink" title="1.

And if you have never used the text-to-speech feature, this post will help you understand <strong>how to do the Siri voice on TikTok.</strong></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-permanent-banishment-from-the-tiktok-community-done-right/"><u>[New] In 2024, Permanent Banishment From the TikTok Community, Done Right</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-text-to-voice-the-ultimate-tiktok-technique-for-2024/"><u>[New] Text-to-Voice The Ultimate TikTok Technique for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-elevate-visual-narratives-on-tiktok-the-top-5-proven-text-techniques/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Elevate Visual Narratives on TikTok The Top 5 Proven Text Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-blue.techidaily.com/updated-from-dull-to-dynamic-an-in-depth-guide-to-hue-mastery/"><u>[Updated] From Dull to Dynamic An In-Depth Guide to Hue Mastery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-ultimate-list-of-the-most-effective-no-cost-tiktok-to-mp3-apps-6/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Ultimate List of the Most Effective, No-Cost TikTok To MP3 Apps (6)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-unlock-tiktoks-potential-with-our-sizzling-template-selection/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Unlock TikTok’s Potential with Our Sizzling Template Selection</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-lessons.techidaily.com/2024-approved-amplifying-photos-keeping-precision/"><u>2024 Approved Amplifying Photos Keeping Precision</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win11.techidaily.com/blackview-minipc-storage-space-speeds-still-sparse/"><u>Blackview MiniPC: Storage Space - Speeds Still Sparse</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/copyright-quest-for-content-creators-tiktok-edition/"><u>Copyright Quest for Content Creators (TikTok Edition)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-resources.techidaily.com/create-powerful-biz-decks-with-no-cost-templates/"><u>Create Powerful Biz Decks with No-Cost Templates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-download.techidaily.com/download-compatible-drivers-for-the-corsair-h80i-v2-aio-cooler/"><u>Download Compatible Drivers for the Corsair H80i V2 AIO Cooler</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/easy-steps-for-exceptional-tiktok-video-experience/"><u>Easy Steps for Exceptional TikTok Video Experience</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-blog.techidaily.com/free-conversion-of-mp4-files-to-mkv-format-a-step-by-step-guide/"><u>Free Conversion of MP4 Files to MKV Format: A Step-by-Step Guide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-quick-screen-cut-and-paste-in-winoses/"><u>In 2024, Quick Screen Cut & Paste in WinOSes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/quick-reinstatement-vanished-visuals/"><u>Quick Reinstatement Vanished Visuals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/snapchats-money-making-opportunities-exposed/"><u>Snapchat's Money-Making Opportunities Exposed</u></a></li><li><a href="https://techtrends.techidaily.com/tecnicas-experto-para-hacer-de-windows-10-tu-plataforma-ideal-de-juego-guia-completa/"><u>Técnicas Experto Para Hacer De Windows 10 Tu Plataforma Ideal De Juego [Guía Completa]</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-information.techidaily.com/top-5-samsung-gear-360-camera-alternatives/"><u>Top 5 Samsung Gear 360 Camera Alternatives</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/what-is-geo-blocking-and-how-to-bypass-it-on-motorola-defy-2-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>What is Geo-Blocking and How to Bypass it On Motorola Defy 2? | Dr.fone</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

Here’s a handy guide on <strong>Triller vs TikTok</strong>.</p><p>On August 6, 2020, President Donald Trump announced that he would take steps to ban TikTok - the popular short-term video app from operating in the USA, unless the app’s US operations were sold to an American company. With a rising tide of uncertainties surrounding TikTok’s future in the United States, TikTokers and short-form video creators are getting drawn to rival platforms like Triller.</p><p>The Trump administration and other critics of TikTok fear that the data the app collects in its US users might end up in the hands of the Chinese government. However, TikTok has said that it stores users’ data outside China and that it would resist any attempts by Beijing to grab the information.</p><p>Amid these confidentiality concerns and an impending ban imposed by the Trump administration, more and more users are now switching to Triller. In fact, as TikTok faces uncertainties between being banned or bought in the US, rival app Triller has received a big boost and attained the No.1 spot in Apple’s US App Store.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/triller-vs-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Triller Vs Tiktok"                ></p><p>With TikTok vs. Triller going on all around, here’s a detailed insight on everything you need to know about these social video apps.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Is Triller &amp; What Is TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Who Uses Triller &amp; Tiktok?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Triller Vs TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How To Make Money On The Two Apps?</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-Is-Triller-What-Is-TikTok"><a href="#What-Is-Triller-What-Is-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="What Is Triller &amp; What Is TikTok?"></a>What Is Triller &amp; What Is TikTok?</h2><h4 id="Triller"><a href="#Triller" class="headerlink" title="Triller"></a>Triller</h4><p>Triller is an artificial intelligence-driven video app released in the year 2015, thus allowing users to film videos with music. Then, the video and music content is synced algorithmically, thus automating the editing part which users can manually do on TikTok. Users can record multiple takes of themselves and using AI, the app will compile the best clips together for creating a music video.</p><p>Triller is a music video app that’s specifically built for creators. In Triller, users can collaborate with each other, use custom or existing sounds, and filters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-triller.jpg"                      alt="What Is Triller"                ></p><h4 id="TikTok"><a href="#TikTok" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h4><p>Launched in the year 2016, TikTok served the Chinese market originally. A year later, when TikTok appeared on mobile platforms around the world, it completely swept off the internet. Owned by ByteDance - a Beijing-based internet technology company, it is a Chinese social video-sharing app.</p><p>With this app, users can record a video with their smartphone, edit the video, add music, and then upload it on the platform. It is a short-form video sharing mobile app that lets users create and share 15-second videos on any topic. Today, with more than 800 million monthly active users and 1.5 billion downloads; TikTok is one of the most popular mobile applications worldwide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="What Is Tiktok"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1880956/19272" target="_top" id="1880956">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1880956" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1880956/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Who-Uses-Triller-Tiktok"><a href="#Who-Uses-Triller-Tiktok" class="headerlink" title="Who Uses Triller &amp; Tiktok?"></a>Who Uses Triller &amp; Tiktok?</h2><p>Triller, the most popular alternative to TikTok is one of the many video-led social applications that are riding a wave of anti-TikTok sentiments. In the words of Triller co-owner Ryan Kavanaugh, “We see ourselves as the adult version of TikTok”. The target audience of this music video-sharing app is between the age group of 17 to 27. Mainly, it is popular among top streaming artists, hip hop artists, and the music industry.</p><p>On the other hand, TikTok has a strong reputation for being popular with teenagers and young adults, the GenZ. While 27% of its total users are between the age group of 13-17 years, its largest age demographics (42%) are the younger adults. So when combined, the 13-24 age group represents about 69% of the app’s user base.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-uses-triller-vs-tiktok.jpeg"                      alt="Who Uses Triller Vs Tiktok"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><span id="1993645">                    <video width="576" height="240" style="cursor:pointer"           poster="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993645.png"           onclick="if(!this.playClicked){this.play();this.setAttribute('controls',true);this.playClicked=true;}">       <source src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22993-1993645">       <img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-clicktoplayimage/1993645.png"                      style="border: none; height: 100%; width: 100%; object-fit: contain"                >    </video>    <div style="width:360px;text-align:center"><a class="link"   href="javascript:window.open(decodeURIComponent('https%3A%2F%2Fhomestyler.sjv.io%2Fc%2F5597632%2F1993645%2F22993'), '_blank');void(0);" >Click here <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></div></span><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1993645/22993"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1896546/19272" target="_top" id="1896546">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1896546" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1896546/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Triller-Vs-TikTok-Features-Comparison-Similarities-Differences"><a href="#Triller-Vs-TikTok-Features-Comparison-Similarities-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Triller Vs TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences"></a>Triller Vs TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</h2><p>At a glance, TikTok and Triller seem to have a lot in common. These social video apps provide users with an excellent way to showcase their creativity. Both these apps allow you to edit and share videos, have an extensive music library, and allow you to share videos on other social networking apps.</p><p>But, besides the similarities, there are major differences. In fact, with the Trump administration’s concerns over TikTok, many are contemplating Triller vs. TikTok. Even though both the apps offer pretty much similar services, certain features set them apart from each other.</p><p>Here’s a handy comparison outlining the notable differences between TikTok and Triller:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Features</th><th>TikTok</th><th>Triller</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Place Of Origin</td><td>China</td><td>Los Angeles</td></tr><tr><td>Users</td><td>800 million active users, with more than 2 billion downloads</td><td>65 million active users, with more than 250m downloads</td></tr><tr><td>Discover Page</td><td>Trending hashtags, promoted ad campaigns</td><td>Leaderboards, trending hashtags, categorized genre charts, promoted ad campaigns</td></tr><tr><td>Video Duration</td><td>TikTok users can make videos of 15 seconds only</td><td>Triller users can make full music videos to whole tracks</td></tr><tr><td>Video Editing Capabilities</td><td>User-based, ability to add text in particular parts of the clips, range of speeds, effects, overlays, etc.</td><td>A.I.-based, fast motion&#x2F;slow motion, text (basic), overlays</td></tr><tr><td>Music</td><td>Only allows listening to 15-seconds of a song, only lets you use music that is ingested in the app in the videos</td><td>Only allows listen to full songs, can use music that is Triller, Spotify, or Apple Music</td></tr><tr><td>AI Deployment</td><td>Analyzes the users’ preferences and interests through engagement and displays a personalized feed to every user</td><td>Analyzes biometric movements of videos and adapts them to a song’s beat</td></tr><tr><td>Genre</td><td>TikTokers can make videos on any topic, regardless of the genre</td><td>Triller seems to favor EDM and hip-hop</td></tr><tr><td>Sharability</td><td>Can download videos to share to other social networking sites</td><td>Can download videos to share to other social networking sites</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="How-To-Make-Money-On-The-Two-Apps"><a href="#How-To-Make-Money-On-The-Two-Apps" class="headerlink" title="How To Make Money On The Two Apps?"></a>How To Make Money On The Two Apps?</h2><p>Amid Triller vs. TikTok, the hunt for the better social video platform is on. Although TikTok’s fate in the US is still hanging on the balance, its popularity and usage still continue to sky-rocket in other territories.</p><p>Wondering if you should really switch to Triller or stick with TikTok, for now, to show off your brand? Read on for a quick review.</p><p><strong>Triller vs. TikTok: For Marketing Influencers</strong></p><p>TikTok is undoubtedly a better social video platform for marketing influencers worldwide in terms of reach. Wondering why? Well, in comparison to Triller’s 65m, TikTok has 800 million active users. Moreover, unlike Triller that’s available only in 50 countries, TikTok is available in 155 countries. Also, TikTok has successfully launched a generation of influencers who had started as non-celebrities.</p><p><strong>Triller vs. TikTok: For Brand Building</strong></p><p>Leveraging TikTok can be the key to increasing social brand awareness. This is because with TikTok’s audience growing BY every second, you can use the platform to build your brand. Triller also gives brands a great platform for increasing exposure and get a better share of voice on social media. Just like TikTok, Triller is a fun way for brands to promote their products in their video content.</p><p><strong>Triller vs. TikTok: For Advertising</strong></p><p>TikTok provides advertisers with several options to reach their target demographic. When TikTokers open the app, ads appear and take over the screen completely for a few seconds before it turns into an in-feed video ad. From ad creation and targeting to insight reports and ad management tools, TikTok ads offer an easy-to-use and powerful platform for businesses to advertise. On the other hand, Triller doesn’t include ads currently. Instead, it focuses on letting creators raise money from followers and advertisers as well as crowdfund.</p><p><strong>Triller vs. TikTok: For Content Creators</strong></p><p>To choose the better platform between Triller and TikTok, consider asking yourself a few questions like – What kind of content creators are you creating? Do you spend more time in conceptualizing the message of your video? Would you rather simplify the editing process or have greater flexibility in editing?</p><p>While TikTok features a range of editing tools to give content creators the flexibility of creating the content they want, Triller deploys AI to edit videos for the creator. So, with Triller, you can simply let artificial intelligence compile the best clips for creating a quality video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-money-on-triller-tiktok.png"                      alt="Make Money On Triller Tiktok"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2080328/19272" target="_top" id="2080328">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2080328" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2080328/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>source：<a class="link"   href="http://www.startupnews.fyi/" >www.startupnews.fyi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>At a time when the internet is divided on whether they should abandon TikTok, the Trump administration approved a deal for Walmart and Oracle to acquire stakes in the US operations of TikTok, thus postponing the potential ban that was planned due to the national security concerns regarding the Chinese owned company. So, US-based TikTokers can finally sigh in relief.</p><p>In summary, both TikTok and Triller offer incredible value to their expanding user base.

Prefer to use some interesting captions for your live videos so that they can capture more attention online.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://facebook-clips.techidaily.com/new-cut-rate-video-upgrade-turning-fb-videos-into-mp4-hd1080p/"><u>[New] Cut-Rate Video Upgrade Turning FB Videos Into MP4 HD/1080P</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-glue.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-complete-guide-to-ios-snapshots-and-more/"><u>[New] In 2024, Complete Guide to iOS Snapshots and More</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-innovate-your-tiktok-openings-with-macos-expertise/"><u>[New] In 2024, Innovate Your TikTok Openings with MacOS Expertise</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-social-scoops-a-battle-for-short-form-video-supremacy-likes-vs-tiktok/"><u>[New] In 2024, Social Scoops A Battle for Short-Form Video Supremacy, Likes Vs.

For iPhone users, Siri is not new. Siri helps them read text messages and much more, but soon after the text-to-speech feature was added in TikTok, it took the TikTokers world by storm. But since the voice sounded so much like Siri, people started calling it Siri voice rather than text-to-speech. This feature allows users to convert any text into a speech using an automated voice. And if you have never used the text-to-speech feature, this post will help you understand <strong>how to do the Siri voice on TikTok.</strong></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is Siri Voice?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">TikTok Voice Changer Apps</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Siri-Voice"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Siri-Voice" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Siri Voice?"></a>Part 1: What is Siri Voice?</h2><p>Siri voice in TikTok is basically an automated voice feature where the voice reads out the text on the video. The feature is called text-to-speech. So, whenever you enable it on your video, the text will be read out loud, which makes the video watching experience fun. Therefore, those who want to add a voice to their TikTok videos can use the text-to-speech feature and let the automated voice do that talking.</p><p>You will find almost everyone using it, even those who often use their voice in TikTok videos, and that’s because many TikTok users find it entertaining and funny. Well, no matter why you want to use this feature, find out <strong>how to do Siri voice on TikTok</strong> without any hassle in the next part!</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Do-Siri-Voice-on-TikTok"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Do-Siri-Voice-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?"></a>Part 2: How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?</h2><p>To do Siri voice on TikTok, you will have to follow just a few simple steps. Here are the steps that you need to take care of:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch TikTok on your mobile phone.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start recording a video; else, upload an already recorded video.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap the Upload button and then click on the checkmark.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, begin writing something on the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Tap on the text you have just written, and you will see the Text-to-Speech option.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Click on that and hear the automated voice reading your text.

Try These TikTok Voice Changer Apps</h2><p>If you are not impressed with the Siri voice on TikTok and would instead like to use some other fun and peppy voice for the text, the good news is there are tons of apps that can help you do that. But before we share the names of the apps, let’s throw some light on why people are looking for such apps. First, if you are using TikTok’s text-to-speech feature in North America, you will hear a computer-automated female voice who will read out the text of the video.</p><p>But, when it comes to the UK, the app uses a computer-generated male voice with a rockin’ accent instead of a female voice. However, recently the voiceover artist of the female voice has filed a lawsuit against the company, saying that she never permitted TikTok to use her voice for text-to-speech, which is why TikTok is now using a cheerful valley girl voice for the text-to-speech feature. Unfortunately, TikTok users are not happy with the new voice, making them look for the best TikTok voice generator apps.</p><p>If you also want to add another voice for the text-to-speech, here are our hand-picked top and best 5 TikTok voice generator apps for iOS and Android.</p><h3 id="1-Voice-Changer"><a href="#1-Voice-Changer" class="headerlink" title="1.
