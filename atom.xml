For iPhone users, Siri is not new. Siri helps them read text messages and much more, but soon after the text-to-speech feature was added in TikTok, it took the TikTokers world by storm. But since the voice sounded so much like Siri, people started calling it Siri voice rather than text-to-speech. This feature allows users to convert any text into a speech using an automated voice. And if you have never used the text-to-speech feature, this post will help you understand <strong>how to do the Siri voice on TikTok.</strong></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is Siri Voice?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">TikTok Voice Changer Apps</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Siri-Voice"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Siri-Voice" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Siri Voice?"></a>Part 1: What is Siri Voice?</h2><p>Siri voice in TikTok is basically an automated voice feature where the voice reads out the text on the video. The feature is called text-to-speech. So, whenever you enable it on your video, the text will be read out loud, which makes the video watching experience fun. Therefore, those who want to add a voice to their TikTok videos can use the text-to-speech feature and let the automated voice do that talking.</p><p>You will find almost everyone using it, even those who often use their voice in TikTok videos, and that’s because many TikTok users find it entertaining and funny. Well, no matter why you want to use this feature, find out <strong>how to do Siri voice on TikTok</strong> without any hassle in the next part!</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Do-Siri-Voice-on-TikTok"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Do-Siri-Voice-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?"></a>Part 2: How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?</h2><p>To do Siri voice on TikTok, you will have to follow just a few simple steps. Here are the steps that you need to take care of:</p><p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch TikTok on your mobile phone.</p><p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Start recording a video; else, upload an already recorded video.</p><p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Tap the Upload button and then click on the checkmark.</p><p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Now, begin writing something on the screen.</p><p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Tap on the text you have just written, and you will see the Text-to-Speech option.</p><p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Click on that and hear the automated voice reading your text.

Try These TikTok Voice Changer Apps</h2><p>If you are not impressed with the Siri voice on TikTok and would instead like to use some other fun and peppy voice for the text, the good news is there are tons of apps that can help you do that. But before we share the names of the apps, let’s throw some light on why people are looking for such apps. First, if you are using TikTok’s text-to-speech feature in North America, you will hear a computer-automated female voice who will read out the text of the video.</p><p>But, when it comes to the UK, the app uses a computer-generated male voice with a rockin’ accent instead of a female voice. However, recently the voiceover artist of the female voice has filed a lawsuit against the company, saying that she never permitted TikTok to use her voice for text-to-speech, which is why TikTok is now using a cheerful valley girl voice for the text-to-speech feature. Unfortunately, TikTok users are not happy with the new voice, making them look for the best TikTok voice generator apps.</p><p>If you also want to add another voice for the text-to-speech, here are our hand-picked top and best 5 TikTok voice generator apps for iOS and Android.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2082526/7443" target="_top" id="2082526">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2082526" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2082526/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="1-Voice-Changer"><a href="#1-Voice-Changer" class="headerlink" title="1.

And if you have never used the text-to-speech feature, this post will help you understand <strong>how to do the Siri voice on TikTok.</strong></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-exploring-live-sessions-guesting-basics-of-tiktok/"><u>[New] Exploring Live Sessions Guesting Basics of TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-elevate-your-creative-content-the-top-50plus-tiktok-tags/"><u>[New] In 2024, Elevate Your Creative Content The Top 50+ TikTok Tags</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-secrets-to-profit-from-tiktok-in-just-8-ways/"><u>[New] In 2024, Secrets to Profit From TikTok in Just 8 Ways</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-clips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-reinventing-your-avatar-a-detailed-guide-to-changing-tiktok-handle/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Reinventing Your Avatar A Detailed Guide to Changing TikTok Handle</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/updated-essential-tips-for-effective-mov-storage-in-windows-10-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Essential Tips for Effective .mov Storage in Windows 10 for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-share.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-elevating-video-experience-best-youtube-to-avi-companions/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Elevating Video Experience Best YouTube-to-AVI Companions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-support.techidaily.com/updated-soften-image-periphery-with-circular-light-blend-photoshop/"><u>[Updated] Soften Image Periphery with Circular Light Blend Photoshop</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-baffling-battles-a-collection-of-intense-tiktok-games/"><u>2024 Approved Baffling Battles A Collection of Intense TikTok Games</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-reviews.techidaily.com/analyzing-the-long-term-worthiness-of-the-samsung-galaxy-tab-s3-tablet/"><u>Analyzing the Long-Term Worthiness of the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3 Tablet</u></a></li><li><a href="https://smart-video-creator.techidaily.com/erase-distractions-top-video-blur-apps-for-face-and-background/"><u>Erase Distractions Top Video Blur Apps for Face and Background</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-pattern-locks-are-unsafe-secure-your-samsung-galaxy-s23-tactical-edition-phone-now-with-these-tips-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Pattern Locks Are Unsafe Secure Your Samsung Galaxy S23 Tactical Edition Phone Now with These Tips</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/instant-recovery-of-vanished-visuals/"><u>Instant Recovery of Vanished Visuals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-video-tools.techidaily.com/new-reverse-rewind-repeat-mastering-video-reversal-in-final-cut-pro/"><u>New Reverse, Rewind, Repeat Mastering Video Reversal in Final Cut Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/quick-tips-for-crafting-and-perfecting-multisnapping-snapchat-stories/"><u>Quick Tips for Crafting and Perfecting Multisnapping Snapchat Stories</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discover-best.techidaily.com/winxdvd-eula-comprehensive-guide-by-digiarty-software/"><u>WinXDVD EULA: Comprehensive Guide by Digiarty Software</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The drastic move comes months after the Trump administration first teased the idea of outlawing this immensely popular video-sharing app due to national security concerns.</p><p>U.S. officials are concerned that this Chinese-owned and operated app can potentially pass on US users’ data to the Chinese government. And, with TikTok facing uncertainty in the U.S. between being banned or bought by an American company, many predict Likee may soon surpass TikTok. This has sparked the debate of Likee vs. TikTok.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/likee-vs-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Likee Vs Tiktok"                ></p><p>With TikTok mired in uncertainty in the US, users are jumping to other video-sharing apps. The continual privacy concerns over TikTok may have opened the window for competitors such as Likee to try seizing the opportunity and take the social media throne. But, so far it hasn’t been successful in surpassing TikTok since the app is at least 50 million weekly active users behind TikTok.</p><p>Here’s a detailed insight on Likee vs. TikTok.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Who Uses Likee &amp; TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Likee vs. TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Will Likee Surpass TikTok?</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-Is-Likee-What-Is-TikTok"><a href="#What-Is-Likee-What-Is-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?"></a>What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?</h2><h4 id="Likee"><a href="#Likee" class="headerlink" title="Likee"></a>Likee</h4><p>Launched in the year 2017, Likee allows users to create short videos easily with intuitive editing tools. Formerly known as ‘Like’, this photo and video editing app give users the freedom to experiment on their videos and photos as much as they want. Just like TikTok, Likee is a social video platform that provides several fun ways to create music videos, short videos, and recreate famous scenes from movies, as well as share funny moments with followers. The app utilizes an artificial intelligence algorithm for exact content recommendations for its users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/likee.png"                      alt="Likee Features"                ></p><h4 id="TikTok"><a href="#TikTok" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h4><p>Released in September 2016, TikTok is the most popular short-form, video-sharing app. Often referred to as a “lip-syncing” app, it gives users the freedom to create and share 15-second mobile videos on any topic. It is a fun and entertaining app that has emerged as one of the biggest marketing and social networking platforms today.</p><h2 id="Who-Uses-Likee-TikTok"><a href="#Who-Uses-Likee-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Who Uses Likee &amp; TikTok?"></a>Who Uses Likee &amp; TikTok?</h2><p>Likee is one of the many social-video sharing apps that have been making waves worldwide amid the privacy concerns and the ban imposed by the Trump administration on TikTok. The app is best for older teens and young adults. The app is ideal for users who love singing and dancing. Also, the app lets users star in their own music video and then share them online.</p><p>For teenagers who understand what’s apt to post in social media, can keep negative comments in perspective, and are prepared for some mature comment, Likee provides a great deal of entertainment and opportunities to show off creativity. The app has a 17+ age restriction.</p><p>Just like Likee, teenagers and younger people are the main users of TikTok. It is used by GenZ as a platform to express their creativity. According to GlobalWebIndex, about 41% of TikTok’s users are of the age group 16 to 24. A majority of TikTok’s users are content creators who wish to expand their reach through short videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-uses-likee-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Who Uses Likee Tiktok"                ></p><h2 id="Likee-vs-TikTok-Features-Comparison-Similarities-Differences"><a href="#Likee-vs-TikTok-Features-Comparison-Similarities-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Likee vs. TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences"></a>Likee vs. TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</h2><p>Ever since its launch in 2016, TikTok has been growing in popularity all over the world. It is a social platform for sharing short videos. As with Likee, it is the perfect tool for creating the most amazing multimedia content that you can think of.</p><p>Both these apps are used for creating and sharing short videos on social media and are compatible with Android as well as iOS devices. Each of these apps offers a range of attractions for their young users.</p><p>With people debating on whether to stick with TikTok or switch to Likee, are you confused about what sets apart these video-sharing apps from each other? Here’s a detailed comparison of Likee vs. TikTok.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Features</th><th>TikTok</th><th>Likee</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Headquarters</td><td>China</td><td>Singapore</td></tr><tr><td>Platform Type</td><td>TikTok is a PGC (Profession Generated Content) platform</td><td>Likee is a UGC (User Generated Content) platform</td></tr><tr><td>Video Editing Options</td><td>A multitude of video effects Emojis, text, frames, trimming videos, and much more</td><td>AI &amp; AR-based technology Realistic hair color filters, 4D magic, superpower effects</td></tr><tr><td>Music Options</td><td>Broad and up-to-date music catalog. Third-party apps are needed to add their own music</td><td>The built-in music library is fairly limited to TikTok. Allows users to add ‘local music’</td></tr><tr><td>Text Options</td><td>Text boxes with accurate timing and positioning. The background color is adjustable</td><td>Multiple text boxes with accurate timing. Ability to change the size, font, color, angle, and background</td></tr><tr><td>Socialization</td><td>TikTok aims to redefine digital socialization by introducing online video socialization</td><td>Likee allows user to watch live streaming and make new friends by People Nearby function</td></tr><tr><td>Users</td><td>800 million active users worldwide</td><td>150 million monthly active users</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="Will-Likee-Surpass-TikTok"><a href="#Will-Likee-Surpass-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Will Likee Surpass TikTok?"></a>Will Likee Surpass TikTok?</h2><p>With the whole “TikTok being banned in the US” becoming a thing, some assumed that competitors will soon surpass TikTok. However, no competitor, including Likee has been successful in doing so. Although some users switched to other video-sharing apps in panic, TikTok remains to be in the spotlight even today. Moreover, after a deal was sealed with Walmart and Oracle, it appears that TikTok will be able to continue its operations in the U.S.</p><p>Whether TikTok is really a national security concern remains unclear. But, one thing is clear - just like TikTok, Likee isn’t protected from scrutiny over apps with Chinese roots. Likee is owned by a company based in Singapore which in turn was purchased by China’s JOYI. Moreover, with India already ousting Likee along with other Chinese apps for being a threat to national security, the Trump administration isn’t far behind.</p><p>Listed below are a few major reasons TikTok will maintain its top spot and popularity amid all privacy concerns for the years to come.</p><h4 id="1-TikTok-Is-Highly-Addictive"><a href="#1-TikTok-Is-Highly-Addictive" class="headerlink" title="1.TikTok Is Highly Addictive"></a>1.TikTok Is Highly Addictive</h4><p>People on Facebook and Instagram might know that time flies by once they start scrolling through the news feed. But, TikTok is much more addictive than Facebook and Instagram. People on TikTok spend 55 minutes on the app on average. This is very interesting since it depicts the great potential for marketers.</p><p>Mostly, TikTok users spend their time in binge-watching videos. What makes TikTok so addictive is that the app enables users to express themselves through different creative ways.</p><h4 id="2-Native-Content-Editor"><a href="#2-Native-Content-Editor" class="headerlink" title="2.Native Content Editor"></a>2.Native Content Editor</h4><p>TikTok’s features to shoot footage, quickly trim and stitch together video clips and incorporate voice as well as music effects at the touch of a button makes it the ideal destination for every creator. When it comes to Likee vs. TikTok, what makes the trim feature of TikTok so enticing is that the app allows creators to storyboard their videos and publish their finished product.</p><h4 id="3-Its-Feed-Is-Wired-For-Viral-Videos"><a href="#3-Its-Feed-Is-Wired-For-Viral-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3.Its Feed Is Wired For Viral Videos"></a>3.Its Feed Is Wired For Viral Videos</h4><p>The homepage of TikTok is much more like Twitter than Instagram or Facebook. This means that viral videos with great engagement move to the front of the line and comprise the feed. Although a “Discover” tab allows you to browse specific topics and hashtags, you are served with one video at a time.</p><p>This is a part of TikTok’s competitive advantage over Likee. With an endless number of prompts, it is easy to participate since you need not have anything interesting to talk about to get started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-problem.jpg"                      alt="Tiktok Problem"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2137213/26400" target="_top" id="2137213">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2137213" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2137213/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>source：<a class="link"   href="http://www.theguardian.com/" >www.theguardian.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>No matter whether you are social media lurker or a content creator, be assured that TikTok is here to stay. Don’t believe us? Try Likee for yourself and you will soon realize that TikTok is unmatchable. In fact, with a constant surge in popularity of TikTok, it is all set to become the biggest video-sharing app ever. So with that being said, do you really think Likee can surpass TikTok?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1918679/19272" target="_top" id="1918679">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1918679" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1918679/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/new-10-best-hashtag-tracker-for-facebook-twitter-and-instagram-for-2024/"><u>[New] 10 Best Hashtag Tracker for Facebook, Twitter and Instagram for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-streaming-essentials-mastering-discord-recordings/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Streaming Essentials Mastering Discord Recordings</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-unlock-creative-potential-crafting-tiktok-videos-using-templates/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Unlock Creative Potential Crafting TikTok Videos Using Templates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://snapchat-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-best-practices-for-mobile-snapchat-recording-techniques/"><u>[New] In 2024, Best Practices for Mobile Snapchat Recording Techniques</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-seasons-skate-top-10-2022-review/"><u>[New] Season's Skate Top 10 - 2022 Review</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-push-the-limits-a-review-of-lgs-27uhd68-freesync-display/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Push the Limits A Review of LG’s 27UHD68 FreeSync Display</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-how-to-download-and-share-tiktok-videos-on-iphone-no-watermark-present/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, How to Download and Share TikTok Videos on iPhone, No Watermark Present</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/discover-7-best-free-macos-compatible-tiktok-tools-for-2024/"><u>Discover 7 Best Free, MacOS Compatible TikTok Tools for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-files.techidaily.com/in-2024-aquatic-adventures-unveiled-tips-on-captivating-underwater-video-with-a-gopro/"><u>In 2024, Aquatic Adventures Unveiled Tips on Captivating Underwater Video with a GoPro</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

But, so far it hasn’t been successful in surpassing TikTok since the app is at least 50 million weekly active users behind TikTok.</p><p>Here’s a detailed insight on Likee vs. TikTok.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Who Uses Likee &amp; TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Likee vs. TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: Will Likee Surpass TikTok?</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-Is-Likee-What-Is-TikTok"><a href="#What-Is-Likee-What-Is-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?"></a>What Is Likee &amp; What Is TikTok?</h2><h4 id="Likee"><a href="#Likee" class="headerlink" title="Likee"></a>Likee</h4><p>Launched in the year 2017, Likee allows users to create short videos easily with intuitive editing tools. Formerly known as ‘Like’, this photo and video editing app give users the freedom to experiment on their videos and photos as much as they want. Just like TikTok, Likee is a social video platform that provides several fun ways to create music videos, short videos, and recreate famous scenes from movies, as well as share funny moments with followers. The app utilizes an artificial intelligence algorithm for exact content recommendations for its users.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/likee.png"                      alt="Likee Features"                ></p><h4 id="TikTok"><a href="#TikTok" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h4><p>Released in September 2016, TikTok is the most popular short-form, video-sharing app. Often referred to as a “lip-syncing” app, it gives users the freedom to create and share 15-second mobile videos on any topic. It is a fun and entertaining app that has emerged as one of the biggest marketing and social networking platforms today.</p><h2 id="Who-Uses-Likee-TikTok"><a href="#Who-Uses-Likee-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Who Uses Likee &amp; TikTok?"></a>Who Uses Likee &amp; TikTok?</h2><p>Likee is one of the many social-video sharing apps that have been making waves worldwide amid the privacy concerns and the ban imposed by the Trump administration on TikTok. The app is best for older teens and young adults. The app is ideal for users who love singing and dancing. Also, the app lets users star in their own music video and then share them online.</p><p>For teenagers who understand what’s apt to post in social media, can keep negative comments in perspective, and are prepared for some mature comment, Likee provides a great deal of entertainment and opportunities to show off creativity. The app has a 17+ age restriction.</p><p>Just like Likee, teenagers and younger people are the main users of TikTok. It is used by GenZ as a platform to express their creativity. According to GlobalWebIndex, about 41% of TikTok’s users are of the age group 16 to 24. A majority of TikTok’s users are content creators who wish to expand their reach through short videos.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-uses-likee-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Who Uses Likee Tiktok"                ></p><h2 id="Likee-vs-TikTok-Features-Comparison-Similarities-Differences"><a href="#Likee-vs-TikTok-Features-Comparison-Similarities-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Likee vs. TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences"></a>Likee vs. TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</h2><p>Ever since its launch in 2016, TikTok has been growing in popularity all over the world. It is a social platform for sharing short videos. As with Likee, it is the perfect tool for creating the most amazing multimedia content that you can think of.</p><p>Both these apps are used for creating and sharing short videos on social media and are compatible with Android as well as iOS devices. Each of these apps offers a range of attractions for their young users.</p><p>With people debating on whether to stick with TikTok or switch to Likee, are you confused about what sets apart these video-sharing apps from each other? Here’s a detailed comparison of Likee vs. TikTok.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Features</th><th>TikTok</th><th>Likee</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Headquarters</td><td>China</td><td>Singapore</td></tr><tr><td>Platform Type</td><td>TikTok is a PGC (Profession Generated Content) platform</td><td>Likee is a UGC (User Generated Content) platform</td></tr><tr><td>Video Editing Options</td><td>A multitude of video effects Emojis, text, frames, trimming videos, and much more</td><td>AI &amp; AR-based technology Realistic hair color filters, 4D magic, superpower effects</td></tr><tr><td>Music Options</td><td>Broad and up-to-date music catalog.

However, no competitor, including Likee has been successful in doing so. Although some users switched to other video-sharing apps in panic, TikTok remains to be in the spotlight even today. Moreover, after a deal was sealed with Walmart and Oracle, it appears that TikTok will be able to continue its operations in the U.S.</p><p>Whether TikTok is really a national security concern remains unclear. But, one thing is clear - just like TikTok, Likee isn’t protected from scrutiny over apps with Chinese roots. Likee is owned by a company based in Singapore which in turn was purchased by China’s JOYI. Moreover, with India already ousting Likee along with other Chinese apps for being a threat to national security, the Trump administration isn’t far behind.</p><p>Listed below are a few major reasons TikTok will maintain its top spot and popularity amid all privacy concerns for the years to come.</p><h4 id="1-TikTok-Is-Highly-Addictive"><a href="#1-TikTok-Is-Highly-Addictive" class="headerlink" title="1.TikTok Is Highly Addictive"></a>1.TikTok Is Highly Addictive</h4><p>People on Facebook and Instagram might know that time flies by once they start scrolling through the news feed. But, TikTok is much more addictive than Facebook and Instagram. People on TikTok spend 55 minutes on the app on average. This is very interesting since it depicts the great potential for marketers.</p><p>Mostly, TikTok users spend their time in binge-watching videos. What makes TikTok so addictive is that the app enables users to express themselves through different creative ways.</p><h4 id="2-Native-Content-Editor"><a href="#2-Native-Content-Editor" class="headerlink" title="2.Native Content Editor"></a>2.Native Content Editor</h4><p>TikTok’s features to shoot footage, quickly trim and stitch together video clips and incorporate voice as well as music effects at the touch of a button makes it the ideal destination for every creator. When it comes to Likee vs. TikTok, what makes the trim feature of TikTok so enticing is that the app allows creators to storyboard their videos and publish their finished product.</p><h4 id="3-Its-Feed-Is-Wired-For-Viral-Videos"><a href="#3-Its-Feed-Is-Wired-For-Viral-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3.Its Feed Is Wired For Viral Videos"></a>3.Its Feed Is Wired For Viral Videos</h4><p>The homepage of TikTok is much more like Twitter than Instagram or Facebook. This means that viral videos with great engagement move to the front of the line and comprise the feed. Although a “Discover” tab allows you to browse specific topics and hashtags, you are served with one video at a time.</p><p>This is a part of TikTok’s competitive advantage over Likee. With an endless number of prompts, it is easy to participate since you need not have anything interesting to talk about to get started.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/tiktok-problem.jpg"                      alt="Tiktok Problem"                ></p><p>source：<a class="link"   href="http://www.theguardian.com/" >www.theguardian.com <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2087485/7443" target="_top" id="2087485">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2087485" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2087485/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>No matter whether you are social media lurker or a content creator, be assured that TikTok is here to stay. Don’t believe us? Try Likee for yourself and you will soon realize that TikTok is unmatchable. In fact, with a constant surge in popularity of TikTok, it is all set to become the biggest video-sharing app ever. So with that being said, do you really think Likee can surpass TikTok?</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-videos.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-harnessing-viral-potential-the-20-best-tiktok-caption-insights/"><u>[New] In 2024, Harnessing Viral Potential The 20 Best TikTok Caption Insights</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-boxes.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-is-inshot-superior-detailed-app-review-unveiled/"><u>[New] In 2024, Is InShot Superior?

TikTok now seems to be a part of everyone’s life through the most popular lip-syncing videos, one-act dance routines, 1-min recipes, funny clips, and stuff like the bottle cap challenge.</p><p>More or less the heart and soul of today’s teenagers and young adults, and sometimes even senior citizens, TikTok now has over 1 billion users and became the World’s 7th most downloaded app, all within a span of 3years since its release in 2016.</p><p>What started with fun and games has become a serious platform to showcase one’s talent and gain followers, earn money, and even stardom. Such provisions have stirred fierce competition among influencers, for what seems like the Wars of Creativity to publish more and more viral-worthy videos.</p><p>If you are an influencer looking for new and amazing <strong>TikTok ideas</strong> to make your videos go viral, then here is a stimulus.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: TikTok vs YouTube</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers</a></li></ul><h2 id="TikTok-vs-YouTube"><a href="#TikTok-vs-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="TikTok vs YouTube"></a>TikTok vs YouTube</h2><p>TikTok may be one of a kind, but it is not the only platform where you can publish your mobile-made videos without much ado. The protagonist of that story is still, YouTube. TikTok being a game-changer in the scene, is giving maximum competition to all other social networks and digital platforms that deal with video-sharing, such as Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook. But the tiff between YouTube and TikTok surpasses all other competitions because only these two are all about Videos.</p><h4 id="Nature-of-Content"><a href="#Nature-of-Content" class="headerlink" title="Nature of Content"></a>Nature of Content</h4><p>The main difference between YouTube and TikTok is the nature of the content. YouTube is a broader spectrum than TikTok, for it contains feature-length movies, episodes of off-air Television Series, music videos, podcasts, and personal videos is just a part of it. But TikTok revolves around short video clips. And just that.</p><h4 id="User-Base"><a href="#User-Base" class="headerlink" title="User Base"></a>User Base</h4><p>TikTok has a niche user base, with the majority of users between 16 and 25 yo. Meanwhile, YouTube reserves a universal user base, catering to people of all ages and from different walks of life.</p><h4 id="Outreach"><a href="#Outreach" class="headerlink" title="Outreach"></a>Outreach</h4><p>TikTok is primarily a casual, youth-centric platform. While it is useful for highlighting one’s talent and engaging a loyal fanbase, it is not ideal for business promotion, or to present a show in a traditional way, which is a substantial offering of YouTube. But on the flip side, due to the vastness of YouTube, short and casual videos like the ones typically available in TikTok, have limited scope to go viral.</p><p>Therefore, the difference between TikTok and YouTube is like Apples and Oranges. They are both fruits and are sweet. But are different species with different tastes.</p><h2 id="Top-10-TikTok-Video-Ideas-to-Boost-More-Followers"><a href="#Top-10-TikTok-Video-Ideas-to-Boost-More-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers"></a>Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers</h2><h4 id="1-Music-Videos"><a href="#1-Music-Videos" class="headerlink" title="1. Music Videos"></a>1. Music Videos</h4><p>A common theme of most viral TikTok videos is they tend to be cute and cuddly. As part of music videos, you are required to imitate certain adorable songs by performing their actions either using your hands or by putting your whole body into action. These songs can be typically found in the trending section of the app and it does not take much effort to figure out the ones that are high in popularity. The catch here is that you need to be among the frontrunners in terms of covering these songs so that you can find yourself a large captive audience to influence at the earliest.</p><p>Here is an example of <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsPbFnhZQ/" >a girl showing off her TikTok music video skills <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="2-Dance-Videos"><a href="#2-Dance-Videos" class="headerlink" title="2. Dance Videos"></a>2. Dance Videos</h4><p>If it is short, funny, and uses the correct hashtags, your dance video can create a lot of influence among your followers. Oh, and don’t forget to pair them up with the correct background score. A song that is already trending and popular on the social platform will only boost your video’s chances of a hit. A short and easy dance always does the business, even better if it can be used for a meme.</p><p>This is a good example of what <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsN-RFmQn/" >your dance video should look like <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Now isn’t that the perfect ingredient for the next viral meme on the market!</p><h4 id="3-Calming-Videos"><a href="#3-Calming-Videos" class="headerlink" title="3. Calming Videos"></a>3. Calming Videos</h4><p>Just because it’s a TikTok video doesn’t mean that it has to be over-the-top and loud. Sometimes, keeping things simple is the secret to success. Calming videos are those where something that most would otherwise consider weird or mundane exerts a feeling of calm on the viewer. Most social media platforms have helped such videos gain immense popularity but finding the right explanation of what these pertain to is a pretty difficult task.</p><p>Look at this video of <a class="link"   href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/705446729114378862/" >color droplets being sprayed from the tip of a brush <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. Did that not calm your mind?</p><h4 id="4-Objects-Singing-Videos"><a href="#4-Objects-Singing-Videos" class="headerlink" title="4. Objects Singing Videos"></a>4. Objects Singing Videos</h4><p>One of the viral TikTok memes had several objects singing Adele’s hit number “ Someone Like You”. This could be something for you to base your ideas on for a new viral video. Use any object around the house, not even necessary that it should move about. The trick lies in finding the right song to pair with, something that will lend a soul to the object and give the impression of the performance coming from a real person.</p><p>See if <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1079418894538940418" >Pikachu and his orchestra can provide you with some inspiration <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="5-Art-Videos"><a href="#5-Art-Videos" class="headerlink" title="5. Art Videos"></a>5. Art Videos</h4><p>This one is for all the artists out there. If you are someone who creates figurines, pictures, or any other form of art, then don’t let your creative process go unnoticed – rather, film it and put it up as a Tik Tok video. The social media platform has many takers for such videos that show the process behind every creative job as it helps give a view into the thought process of an artist, however minute. This is also a good way for you to promote your work on social media, helping you gain greater exposure in the long run. Add some creative twists to these videos and help them stand out in the crowd.</p><p>Here is someone <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BxvZ78YHEUf/" >showing off their artistic skills <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="6-1-Minute-Recipes"><a href="#6-1-Minute-Recipes" class="headerlink" title="6.1-Minute Recipes"></a>6.1-Minute Recipes</h4><p>If you are a cooking aficionado and often dabble around in the kitchen for preparing new recipes, then TikTok is a good place to share your cooking videos. While fitting in the entire video into a matter of a few seconds can prove difficult, it is certainly not impossible. Skip the commentary and speed up the videos but make sure they are of self-explanatory nature. If cooking is not your thing, you can also post videos of what you eat every day – there is a sizable follower base for that category as well!</p><p>Chef Shereen will show you <a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/@cookingwithshereen/video/6841303083289464070" >how to cook a Santa Claus Melon <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> here</p><h4 id="7-Animal-Videos"><a href="#7-Animal-Videos" class="headerlink" title="7.

Be it tricks, reaction to your singing, or simply them having a jolly good time, there is always a lot of attention on pets. If you have not done so already, it is time to capture the acts of your pets on camera and start pulling in the followers. The music needs to be as adorable as the pets themselves and make sure they are at ease doing what you ask them to do. The more authentic the reaction, the more attention your video will get. Use the shots where you get the sincerest reactions to come up with the most interesting clips.</p><p>Just look at this <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzLCv72DpcY/" >adorable little doggo <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="8-Funny-TikTok-Ideas"><a href="#8-Funny-TikTok-Ideas" class="headerlink" title="8.

You can also come up with your own stories about things you observed around you on a day-to-day basis. As long as you keep it hilarious, your fans will love it.</p><h4 id="9-Words-of-Positivity"><a href="#9-Words-of-Positivity" class="headerlink" title="9. Words of Positivity"></a>9. Words of Positivity</h4><p>You are sure to have a favorite song. How about tweaking the lyrics a bit to make it sound more current, something that fits in better with current sentiments? Love for the environment, gender diversity, anti-racism, are some of the genres you can work with. The more resounding your message, the more will be the views it generates. Ensure your new lyrics are in tune with the overall tempo of the song and focus on keeping it positive.</p><p>Here is someone <a class="link"   href="https://twitter.com/i/status/1081608132382609413" >promoting respect for women <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="10-Challenges"><a href="#10-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="10.

Prefer to use some interesting captions for your live videos so that they can capture more attention online.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2135405/19272" target="_top" id="2135405">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2135405" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2135405/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-pioneering-creativity-innovative-mac-methods-for-tiktok-videos/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Pioneering Creativity Innovative Mac Methods for TikTok Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-forgotten-tiktok-reload-a-quick-fix/"><u>[New] Forgotten TikTok Reload A Quick Fix?</u></a></li><li><a href="https://discord-videos.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-pro-tips-for-efficient-message-reactions-on-discord/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Pro Tips for Efficient Message Reactions on Discord</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-files.techidaily.com/2024-approved-from-zero-to-hero-achieving-1k-insta-buddies-in-30-days/"><u>2024 Approved From Zero to Hero Achieving 1K Insta Buddies in 30 Days</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-helps.techidaily.com/benq-bl2711u-a-journey-through-professional-4k-display-tech-for-2024/"><u>BenQ BL2711U - A Journey Through Professional 4K Display Tech for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-sharing-recording.techidaily.com/expert-tips-save-skype-call-as-mp3-free/"><u>Expert Tips Save Skype Call as Mp3 (Free)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-pokemon-go.techidaily.com/how-and-where-to-find-a-shiny-stone-pokemon-for-huawei-p60-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How and Where to Find a Shiny Stone Pokémon For Huawei P60? | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/ideal-10-video-editing-software-for-windowspc-tiktoks/"><u>Ideal 10 Video Editing Software for Windows/PC TikToks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/in-2024-from-page-to-screen-jujutsu-kaisen-on-tiktok/"><u>In 2024, From Page to Screen Jujutsu Kaisen on TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/in-2024-jujutsu-kaisen-in-action-making-memorable-tiktok-videos/"><u>In 2024, Jujutsu Kaisen in Action Making Memorable TikTok Videos</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-that.techidaily.com/top-10-swift-solutions-restoring-widget-functionality-on-ios-devices/"><u>Top 10 Swift Solutions: Restoring Widget Functionality on iOS Devices</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-dash.techidaily.com/1722978421117-update-your-hp-scanjet-printer-drivers-on-windows-1087-free-download/"><u>Update Your HP Scanjet Printer Drivers on Windows 10/8/7 - Free Download</u></a></li></ul></div>]]></content>

The advertising for this Mini PC states that it can actually cool up to 75 Watts, though we’ll have to wait and see whether or not we can actually push TDP that high without causing crashes. With the information available to us, though, this should be one of the most performant Ryzen 7 Hawk Point PCs on the market, period.</p><p> Another point in its favor is that it seemingly supports full-power<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/reviews/best-ram,4057.html" >DDR5 RAM <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> at up to 5600 MT&#x2F;s rather than lower-bandwidth LPDDR5, though you would need to mount “naked” RAM sticks if you were bringing your own, as there definitely isn’t room for RAM heatsinks.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> Below, we’ll be providing some data points for this Mini PC from<a class="link"   href="https://item.jd.com/10097209811046.html" >the original JD.com listing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> before wrapping things up.</p><ul><li>All versions come in barebones (no RAM&#x2F;NVMe), 16GB RAM w&#x2F; 512GB NVMe, or 32GB RAM w&#x2F; 1TB NVMe configurations.</li><li>All Secondary Screen versions include the fingerprint sensor.</li><li>The three APU options are Ryzen 9 6900HX, Ryzen 7 7840HS, and Ryzen 7 8845HS (recommended). The cheapest barebones 8845HS version starts at CNY2699, or roughly $379 USD.</li></ul><p> Besides the core specs and unique form factor with the built-in mini screen, this Mini PC boasts most of the usual I&#x2F;O we’ve come to expect: Dual Ethernet, an undefined USB Type-C port,<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/gpus/hdmi-forum-rejects-amds-hdmi-21-open-source-driver" >HDMI 2.1 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and DisplayPort 1.4 video ports, four USB 3.2 Gen2 ports, a headphone jack, a USB4 Type-C port, and most interestingly, an OCuLink port. The<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/gpd-win-max-2-egpu-benchmarks" >OCuLink port should allow for the unit to maximize the potential of an attached eGPU <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> , especially compared to the slower Thunderbolt and USB4 standards.</p><p> For now, this little mini PC is a China-exclusive that requires some shipping costs to bring elsewhere in the world, but Tianbao may very well end up bringing it stateside via the Aoostar branding, depending on its reception.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-legal-and-ethical-methods-boosting-your-tiktok-profile/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Legal and Ethical Methods Boosting Your TikTok Profile</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-web.techidaily.com/024-approved-unleash-potential-best-gaming-content-to-elevate-your-channel/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Unleash Potential Best Gaming Content to Elevate Your Channel</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-a-bite-into-tiktoks-most-engaging-dishes/"><u>[New] In 2024, A Bite Into TikTok's Most Engaging Dishes</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fox-friendly.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-craft-your-podcasts-identity-with-ai-name-generators/"><u>[New] In 2024, Craft Your Podcast's Identity with AI Name Generators</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-final-steps-for-irreversible-tiktok-un-signup/"><u>[New] In 2024, Final Steps for Irreversible TikTok Un-Signup</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-recording.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-screening-your-gaming-a-nintendo-switch-tutorial/"><u>[New] In 2024, Screening Your Gaming A Nintendo Switch Tutorial</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-the-ultimate-guide-to-visiting-friends-lives-on-tiktok/"><u>[New] In 2024, The Ultimate Guide to Visiting Friends' Lives on TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-unleashing-creativity-a-guide-to-music-infused-videos-for-tiktok/"><u>[New] Unleashing Creativity A Guide to Music-Infused Videos for TikTok</u></a></li><li><a href="https://fake-location.techidaily.com/fake-the-location-to-get-around-the-mlb-blackouts-on-samsung-galaxy-s24-ultra-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>Fake the Location to Get Around the MLB Blackouts on Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://buynow-info.techidaily.com/netgears-advanced-wi-fi-solution-the-nighthawk-x6s-for-seamless-internet-expansion/"><u>Netgear's Advanced Wi-Fi Solution: The Nighthawk X6S for Seamless Internet Expansion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tech-haven.techidaily.com/the-dual-nature-of-ai-boons-and-baneful-risks/"><u>The Dual Nature of AI: Boons & Baneful Risks</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/c/5597632/2129043/19576" target="_top" id="2129043">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19576-2129043" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aidotcom.pxf.io/i/5597632/2129043/19576"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

However, the username is the one that serves to be an identity to your account in the respective platform. So, what is your Tiktok username? Does it sound crazy, funny, or creative? Or else is it a usual one that must be for your official business and marketing purpose? Are you someone who needs more public attention and want to know <strong>how to change the username on Tiktok</strong>?</p><p>If you are the one who wishes to be trending in the Tiktok videos and has more followers, then your username should be the impressive and unbeatable one. If your current username sounds common, and a boring, don’t worry, because it’s never too late to change your Tiktok username. The below write-up will guide you on <strong>how to change the Tiktok username</strong> without hassle.</p><ol><li><strong>Why Username Matters?</strong></li></ol><p>Starting from a Google mail account to a social media account, every entry has a username and a password. Usually, most of us have our names as usernames but in different ways. In contrast, some have their birthday date numerals, favorite personality names, foreign language collage, or their pet names as their username. When it comes to a brand marketing or follow-up page, a good username becomes a vital one. A small, creative, rocking, but a unique username grabs attention rather than long run of alphabets or numbers in serious.</p><p>You must choose a username that is not too complex to remember and simple to communicate and pass on to closed ones. While some think that username is just a space in the account creation, the real fact is that it is the online persona and the representation of an individual in digital means.</p><ol><li><strong>How to Change Username on TikTok: a Step-by-Step Guide</strong></li></ol><p>Changing username for your Tiktok account isn’t difficult, but you must keep in mind that the username gets attached in every post or video that you post from your account. In other words, the username becomes the brand name for your TikTok videos.</p><p>Hence, be cautious that your username isn’t of a standard type because Tiktok allows you to change it once in 30 days only. You would not be able to change it in between. Another factor why a username change is difficult in Tiktok is because Tiktok is very mindful of online safety. A separate team at Tiktok ensures that the account is real and not a fraud or scam.</p><p>Now, there are some rules that a Tiktok user must maintain before proceeding to username creation. Here is the list:</p><ul><li>Avoid using your mail address in place of the username as both are completely for different purpose.</li><li>You should carefully avoid using personal details such as full name, address, or phone number can be avoided as username. Country Names are preferable but don’t go off grainy.</li><li>Never try a username that could get traced to find your account password.</li><li>Avoid usage of inappropriate usernames.</li><li>Avoiding generic names, rather something weird or off the book that can stay at the back of your audience’s head.</li><li>You can let the username be related to your content or intentions.</li><li>If your account is business-based, make an identity based on the brand.</li></ul><p>Have you decided on a username for your Tiktok account, and are ready to change it? Well, then here is a step-by-step guide on <strong>how to change your Tiktok username.</strong></p><p><strong>Step 1</strong>: In your smartphone, open the TikTok application. Log on to your account if not logged in.</p><p><strong>Step 2</strong>: Hit on the icon from the bottom of the main menu screen.</p><p> <strong>Step 3</strong>: Now you need to visit the “Edit Profile” option.</p><p> <strong>Step 4:</strong> Click on the “Username” option.</p><p><strong>Step 5</strong>: Enter the new username by deleting the old one.</p><p><strong>Step 6</strong>: Hit the “Save” button.</p><p>It just takes a couple of minutes to change your Tiktok username.</p><p>Do note that if the name isn’t registered before in the database, you can begin, but if the username is already available, you will get notified and you would have to try out another.</p><ol><li><strong>Get Inspired by Creative and Cool Usernames</strong></li></ol><p>So, you now know <strong>how to change the Tiktok username</strong>, and do you have any idea on how to proceed further. There are different types of tiktokers, and their interest is what makes the difference. Here are some fresh and exciting username suggestions from which you can choose and build your own based on it.</p><p>If you are a motivational tiktoker, try Bean secrets, Elite, cubicle force, Haughty leaders, and Open book. For professional tiktoker, it is the bridge connect, business preachers, capitalist crew, innovation geeks, and passionate entrepreneurs.</p><p>Are you an art or music lover? Dream makers, Icon lover, viola, craft lady, and lasting beauty are some username ideas for you. Especially for makeup tiktokers, Queen hood, butterfly on rose, glowing gold, doll diamond, and bubbles are unbeatable.</p><p>As for rocking game tiktokers, we have electric players, which are aggressively new, extreme, ever since never, flame, gaming changing, life racer, and no limits on hand.</p><p>If you are tired of thinking one, then online username generators like Jimpix and LastPass can lend you a hand.</p><ol><li><strong>Conclusion</strong></li></ol><p>I believe that you would have now come to know what a good username can do to your Tiktok account and <strong>how to change the Tiktok username</strong>. Username can either build your account else shatter it too. In the increasing competition among Tiktokers, the username is the first-sight impressions that bring your account popularity and make them a shining star in the sky of tokers. But one has to be careful that the username created is within the scope of the rules and never a threat to the public or the other Tiktok users. So, for what are you waiting for, Tiktoker? Think of a new username for your account and wait for your account to get noticed by millions of audiences around the world.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-budget-friendly-high-end-mac-tiktok-enhancements/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Budget-Friendly, High-End Mac TikTok Enhancements</u></a></li><li><a href="https://video-capture.techidaily.com/new-the-complete-scrutiny-of-camstudio-screencapture-tech/"><u>[New] The Complete Scrutiny of CamStudio ScreenCapture Tech</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-zen-and-jam-the-best-20-tranquil-country-tracks-to-shake-off-stress-tiktok/"><u>[New] Zen & Jam The Best 20 Tranquil Country Tracks to Shake Off Stress (TikTok)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-comprehensive-guide-to-tiktok-triggers/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Comprehensive Guide to TikTok Triggers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-advanced-tips-for-capturing-gaming-moments-in-overwatch/"><u>[Updated] Advanced Tips for Capturing Gaming Moments in Overwatch</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-exploring-popular-alternatives-to-tiktok-updated-edition-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Exploring Popular Alternatives to TikTok - Updated Edition for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-guide-to-top-10-tiktok-gamers/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate Guide to Top 10 TikTok Gamers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-essential-steps-for-top-tier-tiktok-intros-mac-edition/"><u>2024 Approved Essential Steps for Top-Tier TikTok Intros - Mac Edition</u></a></li><li><a href="https://driver-download.techidaily.com/1722974916363-easy-setup-get-your-hp-officejet-5740-software-now/"><u>Easy Setup: Get Your HP OfficeJet #5740 Software Now</u></a></li><li><a href="https://games-able.techidaily.com/find-your-favorite-top-11-free-words-players-iosandroid/"><u>Find Your Favorite: Top 11 Free Words Players (iOS/Android)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-frp.techidaily.com/in-2024-easy-guide-how-to-bypass-oneplus-nord-n30-se-frp-android-10111213-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Easy Guide How To Bypass OnePlus Nord N30 SE FRP Android 10/11/12/13</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-get-youtube-sponsorship-for-small-channels-easy/"><u>In 2024, How to Get YouTube Sponsorship for Small Channels (Easy)</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-transfer.techidaily.com/in-2024-how-to-transfer-from-apple-iphone-8-to-iphone-81111-pro-drfone-by-drfone-transfer-from-ios/"><u>In 2024, How to Transfer from Apple iPhone 8 to iPhone 8/11/11 Pro | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://data-wizards.techidaily.com/rectifying-video-glitches-post-windows-11-switch/"><u>Rectifying Video Glitches Post-Windows 11 Switch</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/virtual-performances-on-kuaishou/"><u>Virtual Performances on Kuaishou</u></a></li><li><a href="https://howto.techidaily.com/vivo-y78t-screen-unresponsive-heres-how-to-fix-it-drfone-by-drfone-fix-android-problems-fix-android-problems/"><u>Vivo Y78t Screen Unresponsive?

Download Video Star App</h4><p>Choosing a location, mounting your iPhone on a tripod, or picking the positions for each of your clones are all important steps you’ll need to take before you actually start recording. There are several apps that enable you to create clone videos easily, but in this article, we are going to show you how you can clone yourself with Video Star. The app can be downloaded from the App Store for free, but additional in-app purchases are necessary if you want to have access to all the power packs Video Star offers. You don’t have to record the video clips with this app since the iPhone’s native camera app is powerful enough to enable you to record high-quality footage.</p><h4 id="2-Edit-Multiple-Video-Clips"><a href="#2-Edit-Multiple-Video-Clips" class="headerlink" title="2. Edit Multiple Video Clips"></a>2. Edit Multiple Video Clips</h4><p>After you record all the positions for your next clone video with the iPhone’s native camera app, you should cut the video clips and keep only the parts where you are perfectly positioned, so your position in one clip doesn’t overlap with other positions. During the video recording process try to create as much separation between two positions in order to avoid any chance of overlapping. One of the best ways to achieve this is to shoot at a location that is spacious enough so you can make enough separation between two positions. Keep in mind that the maximum number of clips you can combine in the Video Star app is limited to just three, so if you want to have more than three clones in the shot you first have to piece together three clips, save them as a single file and then add more clips to the cloned video you created.</p><h4 id="3-Level-up-Your-Videos-with-Video-Star"><a href="#3-Level-up-Your-Videos-with-Video-Star" class="headerlink" title="3. Level up Your Videos with Video Star"></a>3. Level up Your Videos with Video Star</h4><p>Video Star also enables you to shoot your videos from the app, and you can adjust the Countdown before the app starts recording or the Recording Speed. Make sure to enter the lowest Recording Speed value possible, because that way you’ll be recording like TikTok does on fast.</p><p>Tap the Record button, then select the Multiple options, and play the video that contains the song you previously selected. Once you reach the spot in the song where you want to introduce the clone simply tap Set, so the recording will stop at the designated point and you can move to another position. If at any point during recording you realize that your movements extend to your clone’s location, you can simply tap on the hamburger icon and select the Delete Last option.</p><p>To preview the video, you just have to tap on the Scissors icon, and the recorded video will automatically start playing. The Record New Clip in the Scissors menu lets you start from the beginning in case you’re not happy with the results or you can use this option to start recording the video with the second position of your clone.</p><p>When done, head back to the Scissors menu, and tap on the Multi-Layer Clip. This feature doesn’t come with the free version of the app, and you must purchase it in order to create a clone video. This action will enable you to select the back and front clips. After selecting the clips, the Mask Front menu will appear on the screen, choose the Shape option and use the hamburger icon on the right side of the screen to change the video’s shape to Rectangle. Drag the rectangle in the preview window so you can crop the first clip to match the demands of your video and press the Next icon to continue the video editing process.</p><p>Alternatively, you can use the Erase option to remove the unwanted parts of each video. You can find this option in the Mask Front or Mask Back menu, so just select it and use your finger to remove sections of the shot you don’t want to use.</p><p>The Add Effect menu will pop up on the screen so you can add different effects to your first video clip, and then repeat the entire process for the back clip. Once you’ve edited the second clip tap on the Create button to complete the process of making a multilayer clip. Tap Done to save the clip to your camera roll, and upload it to TikTok.</p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Cloning yourself in a video using the Video Star app is a simple process that can be mastered in a short period of time. The Video Star app lets you create as many clones of yourself as you want, so you just have to make sure that your video clips can be easily combined to feature two or more of your clones and have fun exploring the effects that can make your videos look even cooler. If you want to be a success on the TikTok platform, learning how to make clone videos is one of the best ways to do it, so choose your favorite songs and start producing clone yourself videos.</p><p>You can also use <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> to make a split-screen with ease.

These factors include views count and their authenticity, number of engagement, the region where the views come from, and total followers compared to likes. Performance on this social media platform is dynamic as it changes naturally. Besides, the daily funding amount can differ depending on the number of videos released on that day. So, the specific amount differs from one person to another.</p><p>Now that you have an idea of the creator fund payout, you might be wondering about top TikTok creators who have monetized their content.

There is no two way about the fact that this app is the new kid in town. It is highly popular among the younger generation.</p><p>If you are a new TikToker, you need an introduction video. This has to be engaging enough to attract more and more followers. The primary aim of an introduction video is to say high to your followers and tell them about yourself. With this video, they will get to know you better.</p><p>You May Also Like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Upload a Video to TikTok from Mac or PC&gt;&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Section-1-Make-an-Intro-Video-on-TikTok-iPhone"><a href="#Section-1-Make-an-Intro-Video-on-TikTok-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Section 1. Make an Intro Video on TikTok (iPhone)"></a>Section 1. Make an Intro Video on TikTok (iPhone)</h2><p>In case you are all set to create a Tiktok intro video, here are a few tips you need to follow.</p><p>• Including Audio</p><p>At the top of the screen, you will find the option ‘Sound’. This is where you can look through the music. When you are done choosing the song, decide where you would like it to start and play it when you record to sync the shots better. You can also add sound effects and voice-over.</p><p>At present, you can add one song per video inside the app. However, you always have the option to edit the videos using other apps to upload on TikTok.</p><p>In TikTok, you can work with multiple audio layers. For example, you have recorded the clip with in-camera audio, sound effect, music, and anything else you have added. The app will let you lower the camera’s audio volume while raising the music volume.</p><p>• Working with the Text</p><p>For adding title or text to the video, you have to use the Text button. This lets you choose the color, font, and size of the words. If you have used Instagram fonts, this will appear similar. Once you enter the words, choose where you would like to apply them on the screen. You can also set the time and length of the text appearing on the screen.</p><p>• Adding Effects</p><p>Effects are one of the special aspects of TikTok. There are two ways to use them, before or after recording. When you’re done recording the video, you can reverse it, speed it up, or add filters. The app also lets you apply an effect when you are recording.</p><p>Since TikTok videos are mostly viewed on smartphones, vertical orientation is the best option. However, horizontal orientation is also allowed on TikTok. <strong>The best aspect ratio will be 9:16 for TikTok videos</strong> so that they can be viewed properly on any smartphone. Last, but not least, <strong>the dimension has to be 1080 x 1920.</strong></p><h2 id="Section-2-Make-a-TikTok-Intro-Video-on-Mac"><a href="#Section-2-Make-a-TikTok-Intro-Video-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Section 2.
