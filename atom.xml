Create Your TikTok Pixel and Events</strong></p><p>TikTok has an events manager tool to run TikTok ad campaigns that allow you to track activities and app events on your website, just as other social channels use a piece of code. The TikTok pixel integrates well with Google Tag Manager and Shopify. An option is also available to manually install the pixel in your website’s header.</p><p>Once the base code of pixel installs on your site, you will get prompted to set the event rules using either Developer Mode or Standard Mode. You can select any above methods based on your conversion and business path.</p><p><strong>2. Craft Custom Audiences and Create Lookalikes from Them</strong></p><p>Take a second to make custom audiences depending upon app or website activity and your customer lists once your pixel installs.

Create Target Audiences that Aren’t Too Small</strong></p><p>There are around 80 million TikTok users in the U.S. That’s a considerable number, though!</p><p>On TikTok, those same targeting parameters would yield an audience size of 35K monthly active users. So, you need to focus on a pretty large target audience and create a niche around them.</p><p><strong>4. Develop Video Ads Made with TikTok Trends in Mind</strong></p><p>You’re interrupting someone’s feed with a brand ad that the user didn’t ask for but got anyway. Your content should be captivating, designed with TikTok consumption in mind, and concise.</p><p><strong>5.

Download Video Star App"></a>1. Download Video Star App</h4><p>Choosing a location, mounting your iPhone on a tripod, or picking the positions for each of your clones are all important steps you’ll need to take before you actually start recording. There are several apps that enable you to create clone videos easily, but in this article, we are going to show you how you can clone yourself with Video Star. The app can be downloaded from the App Store for free, but additional in-app purchases are necessary if you want to have access to all the power packs Video Star offers. You don’t have to record the video clips with this app since the iPhone’s native camera app is powerful enough to enable you to record high-quality footage.</p><h4 id="2-Edit-Multiple-Video-Clips"><a href="#2-Edit-Multiple-Video-Clips" class="headerlink" title="2. Edit Multiple Video Clips"></a>2. Edit Multiple Video Clips</h4><p>After you record all the positions for your next clone video with the iPhone’s native camera app, you should cut the video clips and keep only the parts where you are perfectly positioned, so your position in one clip doesn’t overlap with other positions. During the video recording process try to create as much separation between two positions in order to avoid any chance of overlapping. One of the best ways to achieve this is to shoot at a location that is spacious enough so you can make enough separation between two positions. Keep in mind that the maximum number of clips you can combine in the Video Star app is limited to just three, so if you want to have more than three clones in the shot you first have to piece together three clips, save them as a single file and then add more clips to the cloned video you created.</p><h4 id="3-Level-up-Your-Videos-with-Video-Star"><a href="#3-Level-up-Your-Videos-with-Video-Star" class="headerlink" title="3. Level up Your Videos with Video Star"></a>3. Level up Your Videos with Video Star</h4><p>Video Star also enables you to shoot your videos from the app, and you can adjust the Countdown before the app starts recording or the Recording Speed. Make sure to enter the lowest Recording Speed value possible, because that way you’ll be recording like TikTok does on fast.</p><p>Tap the Record button, then select the Multiple options, and play the video that contains the song you previously selected. Once you reach the spot in the song where you want to introduce the clone simply tap Set, so the recording will stop at the designated point and you can move to another position. If at any point during recording you realize that your movements extend to your clone’s location, you can simply tap on the hamburger icon and select the Delete Last option.</p><p>To preview the video, you just have to tap on the Scissors icon, and the recorded video will automatically start playing. The Record New Clip in the Scissors menu lets you start from the beginning in case you’re not happy with the results or you can use this option to start recording the video with the second position of your clone.</p><p>When done, head back to the Scissors menu, and tap on the Multi-Layer Clip. This feature doesn’t come with the free version of the app, and you must purchase it in order to create a clone video. This action will enable you to select the back and front clips. After selecting the clips, the Mask Front menu will appear on the screen, choose the Shape option and use the hamburger icon on the right side of the screen to change the video’s shape to Rectangle. Drag the rectangle in the preview window so you can crop the first clip to match the demands of your video and press the Next icon to continue the video editing process.</p><p>Alternatively, you can use the Erase option to remove the unwanted parts of each video. You can find this option in the Mask Front or Mask Back menu, so just select it and use your finger to remove sections of the shot you don’t want to use.</p><p>The Add Effect menu will pop up on the screen so you can add different effects to your first video clip, and then repeat the entire process for the back clip. Once you’ve edited the second clip tap on the Create button to complete the process of making a multilayer clip. Tap Done to save the clip to your camera roll, and upload it to TikTok.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1959759/19272" target="_top" id="1959759">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1959759" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="300" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1959759/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>Cloning yourself in a video using the Video Star app is a simple process that can be mastered in a short period of time.

This tiny device (via<a class="link"   href="https://liliputing.com/onexplayer-m1-is-a-mini-pc-with-intel-core-ultra-9-185h-oculink-and-usb4/" >Liliputing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) has the Intel Core Ultra 9 185H and up to 32 GB of RAM. It also has an RJ45 port, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth 5.2, meaning you have three different connectivity options.</p><p> This tiny device has a 200 mm x 120 mm footprint, making it highly portable—it’s so small that you can fit it inside a relatively loose pocket. It also weighs 600 grams, so you don’t have to worry about hurting your back if you want to move your mini-PC.</p><p> However, this small size means that the mini-PC has only limited slots. It can only accommodate a single M.2 2280 SSD and one SODIMM slot so you can say goodbye to the advantages of dual-channel memory.</p><p> Nevertheless, the OneXPlayer M1 does not lack physical ports to connect your devices. It has two USB4 Type-C ports, one USB 3.2 and one USB 2.0 Type-A port, two HDMI ports, one DisplayPort, an RJ45 ethernet jack, a 3.5 mm<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/audio" >audio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> outlet, and a microSD card reader. More importantly, it also comes with an OCuLink port to give you the option to provide it with the graphical oomph of the OneXGPU eGPU.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> Image 1 of 5</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="OneXPlayer M1 product images"                ></p><p> (Image credit: One-Netbook)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="OneXPlayer M1 product images"                ></p><p> (Image credit: One-Netbook)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="OneXPlayer M1 product images"                ></p><p> (Image credit: One-Netbook)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="OneXPlayer M1 product images"                ></p><p> (Image credit: One-Netbook)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="OneXPlayer M1 product images"                ></p><p> (Image credit: One-Netbook)</p><p> Aside from the Power button, One-Netbook also gave its mini-PC an RGB button to adjust the RGB lights on the case. But what’s interesting is that the Turbo button from PCs in the 1980s and 1990s is returning on the OneXPlayer M1. The Turbo button will push the 185H’s power draw from the base 45 to 60 watts — just five watts short of its maximum configurable TDP. A 100-watt USB-C power supply also powers the mini-PC, so you’ll have ample power, even pushing the processor to its limit.</p><p> The OneXPlayer M1 has almost the same shape and size as the OneXGPU, with the external GPU weighing about 250 grams heavier. The latter also features several ports, including two HDMI ports, two DisplayPort outlets, two USB 3.2 Type-A ports, a USB4 Type-C port with 100 watts reverse power delivery, and a gigabit RJ45 port. This makes both devices perfect for each other, allowing you to get a fully featured computer you could put in two pockets.</p><p> Pre-orders for a 32 GB RAM &#x2F; 1 TB SSD OneXPlayer M1 are already in Japan at JPY142,310 (or around $900). But if you bundle it with the OneXGPU, you get a 10% discount on the eGPU. So, if you’re looking for a small PC you can quickly move around but don’t sacrifice performance and graphical power, you should watch out for the OneXPlayer M1 mini-PC.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-key-points-to-consider-when-navigating-tiktok-web-on-macos/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Key Points to Consider When Navigating TikTok Web on macOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vimeo-videos.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-the-path-to-making-popular-twitch-channels/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved The Path to Making Popular Twitch Channels</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-skyrocketing-success-with-desktop-tiktok-content/"><u>[New] In 2024, Skyrocketing Success with Desktop TikTok Content</u></a></li><li><a href="https://youtube-data.techidaily.com/eading-list-of-16-youtube-openers-for-audience-expansion/"><u>[New] Leading List of 16 YouTube Openers for Audience Expansion</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-unlock-more-likes-and-shares-top-30-tiktok-usernames-for-success/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Unlock More Likes and Shares Top 30 TikTok Usernames for Success</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-beat-o-vision-your-guide-to-the-years-most-shared-rap-tracks-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Beat-O-Vision Your Guide to the Year's Most Shared Rap Tracks for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://article-helps.techidaily.com/updated-beyond-the-basics-non-inshot-pc-video-tools-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Beyond the Basics Non-Inshot PC Video Tools for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-mac-screen-casting-and-microphone-integration/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Mac Screen Casting and Microphone Integration</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-perfecting-the-aesthetic-ootd-tiktok-on-a-mac/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Perfecting the Aesthetic OOTD TikTok on a Mac</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-the-ultimate-list-of-quotes-for-tiktok-stars-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] The Ultimate List of Quotes for TikTok Stars for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-tips.techidaily.com/crafting-harmonious-photographic-mosaics-with-ease-for-2024/"><u>Crafting Harmonious Photographic Mosaics with Ease for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://data-wizards.techidaily.com/maximized-mac-potential-introducing-stellar-speedups/"><u>Maximized Mac Potential - Introducing Stellar Speedups</u></a></li><li><a href="https://win-answers.techidaily.com/optimizing-performance-how-to-handle-high-cpu-drain-in-new-world-adventures/"><u>Optimizing Performance: How to Handle High CPU Drain in 'New World' Adventures</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/2016170/19272" target="_top" id="2016170">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-2016170" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/2016170/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

In order to use this feature, it is important to use the latest version of the TikTok app.</li><li>Users these days are restricted to use banned words to their live videos.

Scheduled for March 19, the bare metal vs. raw power event is set to become a must-watch experience of the annual CloudFest conference.</p><p> According to the dedicated event page,<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/39-year-old-477-mhz-dos-web-server-hits-2500-hours-of-uptime" >server <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> throwing began in Holland about a decade ago and is an “intense underground sport, which has been criticized as ‘needlessly brutal to servers’.” This sport is now emerging from its data-center basement origins and is set to enter the world stage at CloudFest 2024.</p><p> CloudFest provides a few details regarding the 2024 World Server Throwing Championship. This outdoor event in front of a live audience will welcome “up to 40 server-throwing athletes.” All genders and ability levels are welcome to participate as long as they desire to throw a server a great distance. Every athlete will get two measured attempts at server throwing and will hope to be placed in the top three so they can win a prize.</p><p> Though the sport is brutal by its very nature, it is good to see that participants at previous events always wear gloves. Some servers have very sharp edges. If you plan to attend, it might be wise to stand behind participants rather than to the left or right in case of server hurling misjudgment.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> It isn’t clear if there are 1U, 2U, and 4U divisions, or, dare we say it, 8U for the real heavy lifters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/wtmZvaBCUd7W2J88EkoF6b-320-80.jpg"                      alt="Server throwing athletes"                ></p><p> (Image credit: CloudFest)</p><p> If we had to place a bet on the winner’s nationality, it would probably be Dutch, as the country where the sport seems to have become established. We discovered that some of the WTSC partners have already promoted server throwing in Dutch events. The winner of a Dutch national championship event<a class="link"   href="https://dutchcloudcommunity.nl/agenda/summer-bbq-dutch-cloud-community-2022/" >in 2022 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> managed to fling a 10kg+ (22 pounds +) server 12.23 meters (over 40 feet).</p><p> We think there is plenty of room for improvement on the 2022 winning throw. Remember, the world record distance for throwing a 16-pound shot put is nearly 75 feet. For another comparison, in the Swedish sport of Stångstörtning, a roughly 57-pound log is tossed, with the world record distance being 32 feet.

Inevitably by applying some new tactics, it will become a swift game to come across the crowd with the trumpet of winning song.

However, it gives unprecedented results for your TikTok account and posted videos. What you need to do is, at the end of the post (or in the middle also), you need to put some valuable hashtags (the symbol “# followed by a short text without space”), which tells about your video genre. So, whenever any user clicks on the particular hashtags, those users will directly be able to see your video content, media file, or will get directed to your content area. Thus, giving your post a boost. Hence this is how to get views on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Tip-2-Actively-involved-At-least-one-post-per-day"><a href="#Tip-2-Actively-involved-At-least-one-post-per-day" class="headerlink" title="Tip 2: Actively involved: At least one post per day"></a>Tip 2: Actively involved: At least one post per day</h4><p>You must be aware of the idea of activeness. Whoever remains active wins the race. The fact behind is, if you actively engage in posting the content over your TikTok account, then the users will feel the sense of connection, and the chain reaction will increase the size of followers day by day.</p><p>Further, be consistent in posting at least one post per day. It will reflect your keen interest in the TikTok profile.</p><h4 id="Tip-3-‘For-You’-page"><a href="#Tip-3-‘For-You’-page" class="headerlink" title="Tip 3: ‘For You’ page"></a>Tip 3: ‘For You’ page</h4><p>Another valuable trick is to involve&#x2F;include the front page, ‘For You’ page for the users. It will direct and suggest the users’ relevant link, content, or video of their interests according to their search history. So, when any user lands on your page, they will get the content of interest, enhancing their chances of revisiting your profile. Also, you will get an idea of what is the most liked video on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Tip-4-Collaborate-with-your-friends"><a href="#Tip-4-Collaborate-with-your-friends" class="headerlink" title="Tip 4: Collaborate with your friends"></a>Tip 4: Collaborate with your friends</h4><p>Preparing a video or media for the TikTok profile is a good idea, but posting some exciting content along with your friend is a beautiful idea. That will double the chance of getting the more viewer list of your TikTok account. Even you will see that taking the collaboration or help of your friends to create the content will make the video more interactive and exciting.</p><h4 id="Tip-5-Interaction-with-TikTok-users-with-comments"><a href="#Tip-5-Interaction-with-TikTok-users-with-comments" class="headerlink" title="Tip 5: Interaction with TikTok users, with comments"></a>Tip 5: Interaction with TikTok users, with comments</h4><p>Your users are the real source for the promotion of your profile in the TikTok world and to know how to get more views and likes on TikTok. So better be involved with them as much as possible. Actively write comments, so whenever a user visits your profile, they see that you write comments regularly, and most probably revert to your account or profile.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/communicate-with-tiktok-users.jpg"                      alt="Communicate with Tiktok Users"                ></p><p>Image Source: capitalfm.com</p><h4 id="Tip-6-You-profile-must-be-complete"><a href="#Tip-6-You-profile-must-be-complete" class="headerlink" title="Tip 6: You profile must be complete"></a>Tip 6: You profile must be complete</h4><p>In my opinion, this is a very crucial tip to keep your profile up-to-date all the time. It will leave a very positive impression on the users, and whoever lands on your profile will feel the content’s appropriateness. Even you can represent your profile in such a way that it will look not only attractive but also reflect professionalism to the users.</p><h4 id="Tip-7-Selecting-the-most-appropriate-song"><a href="#Tip-7-Selecting-the-most-appropriate-song" class="headerlink" title="Tip 7: Selecting the most appropriate song"></a>Tip 7: Selecting the most appropriate song</h4><p>During the creation of content, TikTok will ask you to select a song for the task.

On top of this, OLED frames are thinner and lighter than their LED predecessors. It’s a powerful combination that makes for a startlingly realistic picture alongside an expanded range of placement options. In the case of the LG C9, it’s a design that’s as smart as it is sleek thanks to the inclusion of Google Assistant and Alexa.</p><p> With its excellent smart features, gorgeous 4K image quality, and an easy-to-use interface, LG has only improved on last year’s model with the LG OLED 65-inch C9 (OLED65C9PUA).</p><p> The LG C9 itself is comprised of a pane of glass that covers the OLED panel. This pane stretches across the front of the TV, leaving a remarkable 0.3 inches between the end of the OLED panel and the metal edge. When it is mounted on a wall, the C9 looks fantastic thanks to this slim, bezel-less design, and while it boasts an impressive 65-inch screen, at no point does this top-of-the-line model exceed a width of 1.8 inches.</p><p> For customers with multiple external devices, such as Blu-ray players or gaming consoles, ports are located along the TV’s left-hand side and directly on its backside. These connection options include 4<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/hdmi-facts-high-definition-multimedia-interface-1847337" >HDMI <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> 2.1 ports, 3<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/universal-serial-bus-usb-2626039" >USB <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ports, one cable&#x2F;antenna input, one LAN port, and audio connections. The HDMI 2.1 ports are especially important since consoles began emerging in 2020 that rely on HDMI 2.1 such as the Playstation 5.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/mxKfDJGuIKYcsSIQoKfzwDbYYmg=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-65inch-4K-TV_1LW4142020_02-3da87ff8439343f691cf02e9234d1f04.jpg"                      alt="LG OLED C9 65-inch 4K Smart TV"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2151869/7443" target="_top" id="2151869">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2151869" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2151869/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p> Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><h2 id="Setup-Process-Do-it-yourself-worthy-but-you’ll-need-a-hand"><a href="#Setup-Process-Do-it-yourself-worthy-but-you’ll-need-a-hand" class="headerlink" title="Setup Process: Do it yourself worthy, but you’ll need a hand"></a><strong>Setup Process: Do it yourself worthy, but you’ll need a hand</strong></h2><p> Due to its large size and fragile nature, consider where the LG C9 will be most secure before moving ahead with setup. It shouldn’t be placed anywhere where there’s a risk it could be knocked down or climbed on, for instance, so choose a location safely tucked away from pets and children.</p><p> Setup options include securing the TV to the wall or using the provided stand as a table mount. Be careful, however, as the slim frame means that it needs to be handled with care regardless of where it’s placed, otherwise the TV is at risk of bending which could damage the OLED panel. You’ll want to make sure you’ve got an extra pair of hands for any lifting or adjusting in order to ensure its safety.</p><p> The LG C9 has a surprisingly good sound system all things considered—but a soundbar would still be recommended.</p><p> We found the mounting setup process to be straightforward for an afternoon DIY project. When choosing a wall mount, be sure to consider your individual needs as not all mounts are compatible with all building materials. If you have a plaster or masonry, for instance, you’re going to need stronger hardware than a typical mount has to offer. If you have drywall then the majority of TV mounts will be compatible with your home.</p><p> The other important factor when selecting a mount is the weight and screen size the mount is capable of holding. In this case, these measurements are 65 inches and 56 pounds. After this, considerations are based on preferences rather than hardware limitations. Do you want your mount to be fixed or flexible? Would you prefer installing the TV at eye level or would you like it to rest higher? Will you be placing it in a corner or on a flat wall? These are important questions to ask because they influence the kind of mount you’ll bring home. When in doubt, most manufacturers include a compatibility check for the TV’s make and model on their website. If you’re not comfortable measuring, leveling, and drilling into studs, it’s well worth the peace of mind to hire a handyman once you’ve made your selection.</p><p> Once the TV has been installed, LG’s WebOS guides the first-time setup process by prompting inputs for settings ranging from time zone and language up to and including any necessary user agreements. The LG C9 will complete a scan in order to identify the devices and then you’re free to customize the TV’s settings by pressing the gear button on the LG Magic Remote. The first setting we changed was the Auto Power Saving (APS) picture mode, which reduces power use by dimming the brightness of the TV. The other important setting to disable is TruMotion, which smooths motion in TV shows and movies by altering the frame rate of the programming. If your LG’s picture looks a bit too much like a soap opera, chances are you need to disable this setting.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://wigfever.sjv.io/c/5597632/2014853/22899" target="_top" id="2014853">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/22899-2014853" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="320" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://wigfever.sjv.io/i/5597632/2014853/22899"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Image-Quality-Stunning-picture"><a href="#Image-Quality-Stunning-picture" class="headerlink" title="Image Quality: Stunning picture"></a><strong>Image Quality: Stunning picture</strong></h2><p> The image quality on the LG C9 is, frankly, stunning thanks in large part to its excellent contrast and wide range of colors, combined with the OLED panel’s ability to turn individual pixels on and off.

It excels at drawing out detail and correcting quality discrepancies within the picture, such as banding which creates textures and strips in areas of the screen that would otherwise be smooth. This is particularly important given the large screen size and high resolution. While it’s not as bright as an LED TV since it lacks backlighting, it doesn’t need it as the TV already possesses excellent color, a change here would risk washing out the inky blacks on the screen.</p><h2 id="Audio-Better-than-expected"><a href="#Audio-Better-than-expected" class="headerlink" title="Audio: Better than expected"></a><strong>Audio: Better than expected</strong></h2><p> While OLED TVs aren’t generally known for their great sound quality, the LG C9 has a surprisingly good sound system all things considered—but a soundbar would still be recommended. Audio in TV or movies is generally good, but it struggles to regulate loud and soft noises in a scene. Streaming Lizzo’s_Cuz I Love You_ on Spotify produces a surprising depth of sound, but it’s simply not comparable to a more robust system that a soundbar or home theater system would provide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://www.lifewire.com/thmb/SZUaFESJi6OZubIeLdK1e9L9FEM=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/LG-65inch-4K-TV_1LW4142020_04-c559e4cc6de64f0c8baf4470f883dd9e-4844a7694fb74eb2904f1128ba93f760.jpeg"                      alt="LG OLED C9 65-inch 4K Smart TV"                ></p><p>Lifewire &#x2F; Emily Isaacs</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/c/5597632/2134497/18498" target="_top" id="2134497">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/18498-2134497" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://unicoeye.pxf.io/i/5597632/2134497/18498"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Software-Smooth-and-easy-to-use"><a href="#Software-Smooth-and-easy-to-use" class="headerlink" title="Software: Smooth and easy to use"></a><strong>Software: Smooth and easy to use</strong></h2><p> As with earlier models, the LG WebOS powers the C9. It’s a user-friendly interface that makes navigating the TV incredibly smooth, enabling you to switch between apps and features built into the<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-smart-tvs-4135681" >smart TV <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> with ease. Meanwhile, the LG Magic Remote can function as a traditional remote control, as a mouse would for a computer screen, or issue voice commands with Google Assistant and Alexa, making navigating the menus second nature. While most major streaming services are already included (Hulu, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Google Play Movies &amp; TV, to name a few) it’s also possible to download additional apps through the LG store. The drawback to the store, however, is that the apps are somewhat limited in availability.</p><p> In addition to the WebOS software, the LG C9 also comes with<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-google-assistant-4120911" >Google Assistant <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> as well as<a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/amazon-alexa-voice-assistant-4152107" >Amazon’s Alexa <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> . It makes it easy to search content, switch between apps and features, or check the weather, among other things. These controls extend into your home as well, enabling you to make use of any basic home control features already in place like updating the temperature on your Nest Smart Thermostat. You simply choose which assistant you want at a given time by pressing either the Amazon button on the Magic Remote to toggle Alexa or the microphone button to toggle Google Assistant.</p><p> In addition to the WebOS software, the LG C9 also comes with Google Assistant as well as Amazon’s Alexa. It makes it easy to search content, switch between apps and features, or check the weather, among other things.</p><h2 id="Price-A-premium-price-for-a-premium-TV"><a href="#Price-A-premium-price-for-a-premium-TV" class="headerlink" title="Price: A premium price for a premium TV"></a><strong>Price: A premium price for a premium TV</strong></h2><p> 65-inch 4K TV’s generally retail for between $800-$5,000, and this cost jumps further as screen size increases. The LG C9 is a premium 4K TV that sits at the top of this curve, offering integrated smart technologies and excellent picture with an intuitive, easy-to-use interface. As such, it comes at a premium price of $2,500 (Amazon) that exceeds the cost of many competitor models, but with so many additional features it’s worth the high price—even if it’s difficult to swallow.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/best-60-inch-tvs-4580159" >How to Buy a TV For Your Home in 2024 <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="LG-OLED-C9-65-inch-vs-Samsung-65-inch-Class-Q60R"><a href="#LG-OLED-C9-65-inch-vs-Samsung-65-inch-Class-Q60R" class="headerlink" title="LG OLED C9 65-inch vs. Samsung 65-inch Class Q60R"></a><strong>LG OLED C9 65-inch vs. Samsung 65-inch Class Q60R</strong></h2><p> It’s easy to see why the LG C9 is such an attractive model. Between its many bells and whistles, it offers superior quality at a premium price. For users looking for a more down-to-earth price point, QLED TV models offer great picture quality at a lower cost and are a major competitor for OLED models.</p><p> The Samsung 65-Inch Class Q60R (QN65Q60RAFXZA) is a QLED TV that relies on edge lighting behind its screen to transmit light. This light shines through quantum dots within the LED panel which then transmit color through to the screen and create a picture. This differs from the LG C9 model which toggles pixels on and off individually to create inkier blacks and better contrast. While this isn’t a deal breaker for the Q60R, it does mean that the LG C9 panel will have a little more punch since it’s better equipped to balance bright whites with darker blacks.</p><p> If image quality is most important to you or if you have a space with wider viewing needs, the LG C9 is the clear winner.</p><p> The Q60R also uses Bixby, Samsung’s AI assistant. Unfortunately, the Bixby integration feels somewhat clunky. It’s not uncommon to repeat instructions when Bixby has difficulty understanding basic instructions. The other caveat to be aware of is that the picture does wash out slightly and lose color when looked at from wide viewing angles. If image quality is most important to you or if you have a space with wider viewing needs, the LG C9 is the clear winner.</p><p> Unlike OLED models, QLED models aren’t prone to burn-in. This is a condition where discoloration occurs over a portion of the screen. This happens when OLED TVs are left on the same channel for extensive periods of time. The Q60R also doubles as an excellent gaming TV or monitor thanks to its variable refresh rates and low input lag which allows the screen to adjust the refresh rate to that of the source. While the C9 also has a variable refresh rate and a low input lag, its variable refresh rate is only compatible with the Xbox One for now since nothing else uses HDMI 2.1 yet. Generally retailing for around $1,000, the Q60R is less than half the cost of the LG C9, making it a better choice for those concerned about price.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://www.lifewire.com/samsung-q60r-series-qled-4k-tv-review-4782061" >Samsung Q60R Series QLED 4K TV Review <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p> Final Verdict</p><p> <strong>An excellent TV you shouldn’t hesitate to buy if you value ease of use and superb image quality.</strong></p><p> With its excellent smart features, gorgeous 4K image quality, and an easy-to-use interface, LG has only improved on last year’s model with the LG OLED C9. That said, these improvements aren’t significant leaps, mainly coming from processor improvements and the addition of HDMI 2.1 ports. If you’re simply looking for the best TV from last year and price isn’t a consideration, look no further. On the other hand, there are other great 65-inch 4K TV models that may not have all the extra features the C9 does, but do have comparable quality without breaking the bank.</p><h2 id="Specs"><a href="#Specs" class="headerlink" title="Specs"></a>Specs</h2><ul><li>Product Name  OLED C9 65” 4K Smart TV</li><li>Product Brand  LG</li><li>Price  $3,499.00</li><li>Weight  74.7 lbs.</li><li>Product Dimensions  57.1 x 33.9 x 9.9 in.</li><li>Warranty  1-year limited warranty</li><li>TV Size without Stand  57.1 x 32.7 x 1.8 inches</li><li>TV Weight without Stand  55.6 pounds</li><li>TV Size without Stand  57.1 x 32.7 x 1.8 inches</li><li>AI Assistant  Google Assistant and Alexa built in</li><li>Network &amp;

Here’s a handy guide on <strong>Triller vs TikTok</strong>.</p><p>On August 6, 2020, President Donald Trump announced that he would take steps to ban TikTok - the popular short-term video app from operating in the USA, unless the app’s US operations were sold to an American company. With a rising tide of uncertainties surrounding TikTok’s future in the United States, TikTokers and short-form video creators are getting drawn to rival platforms like Triller.</p><p>The Trump administration and other critics of TikTok fear that the data the app collects in its US users might end up in the hands of the Chinese government. However, TikTok has said that it stores users’ data outside China and that it would resist any attempts by Beijing to grab the information.</p><p>Amid these confidentiality concerns and an impending ban imposed by the Trump administration, more and more users are now switching to Triller. In fact, as TikTok faces uncertainties between being banned or bought in the US, rival app Triller has received a big boost and attained the No.1 spot in Apple’s US App Store.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/triller-vs-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="Triller Vs Tiktok"                ></p><p>With TikTok vs. Triller going on all around, here’s a detailed insight on everything you need to know about these social video apps.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Is Triller &amp; What Is TikTok?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Who Uses Triller &amp; Tiktok?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: Triller Vs TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How To Make Money On The Two Apps?</a></li></ul><h2 id="What-Is-Triller-What-Is-TikTok"><a href="#What-Is-Triller-What-Is-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="What Is Triller &amp; What Is TikTok?"></a>What Is Triller &amp; What Is TikTok?</h2><h4 id="Triller"><a href="#Triller" class="headerlink" title="Triller"></a>Triller</h4><p>Triller is an artificial intelligence-driven video app released in the year 2015, thus allowing users to film videos with music. Then, the video and music content is synced algorithmically, thus automating the editing part which users can manually do on TikTok. Users can record multiple takes of themselves and using AI, the app will compile the best clips together for creating a music video.</p><p>Triller is a music video app that’s specifically built for creators. In Triller, users can collaborate with each other, use custom or existing sounds, and filters.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-triller.jpg"                      alt="What Is Triller"                ></p><h4 id="TikTok"><a href="#TikTok" class="headerlink" title="TikTok"></a>TikTok</h4><p>Launched in the year 2016, TikTok served the Chinese market originally. A year later, when TikTok appeared on mobile platforms around the world, it completely swept off the internet. Owned by ByteDance - a Beijing-based internet technology company, it is a Chinese social video-sharing app.</p><p>With this app, users can record a video with their smartphone, edit the video, add music, and then upload it on the platform. It is a short-form video sharing mobile app that lets users create and share 15-second videos on any topic. Today, with more than 800 million monthly active users and 1.5 billion downloads; TikTok is one of the most popular mobile applications worldwide.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-tiktok.jpg"                      alt="What Is Tiktok"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1975807/19272" target="_top" id="1975807">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1975807" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1975807/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Who-Uses-Triller-Tiktok"><a href="#Who-Uses-Triller-Tiktok" class="headerlink" title="Who Uses Triller &amp; Tiktok?"></a>Who Uses Triller &amp; Tiktok?</h2><p>Triller, the most popular alternative to TikTok is one of the many video-led social applications that are riding a wave of anti-TikTok sentiments. In the words of Triller co-owner Ryan Kavanaugh, “We see ourselves as the adult version of TikTok”. The target audience of this music video-sharing app is between the age group of 17 to 27. Mainly, it is popular among top streaming artists, hip hop artists, and the music industry.</p><p>On the other hand, TikTok has a strong reputation for being popular with teenagers and young adults, the GenZ. While 27% of its total users are between the age group of 13-17 years, its largest age demographics (42%) are the younger adults. So when combined, the 13-24 age group represents about 69% of the app’s user base.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/who-uses-triller-vs-tiktok.jpeg"                      alt="Who Uses Triller Vs Tiktok"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2075475/7443" target="_top" id="2075475">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2075475" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2075475/7443"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Triller-Vs-TikTok-Features-Comparison-Similarities-Differences"><a href="#Triller-Vs-TikTok-Features-Comparison-Similarities-Differences" class="headerlink" title="Triller Vs TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences"></a>Triller Vs TikTok: Features Comparison - Similarities &amp; Differences</h2><p>At a glance, TikTok and Triller seem to have a lot in common. These social video apps provide users with an excellent way to showcase their creativity. Both these apps allow you to edit and share videos, have an extensive music library, and allow you to share videos on other social networking apps.</p><p>But, besides the similarities, there are major differences. In fact, with the Trump administration’s concerns over TikTok, many are contemplating Triller vs. TikTok. Even though both the apps offer pretty much similar services, certain features set them apart from each other.</p><p>Here’s a handy comparison outlining the notable differences between TikTok and Triller:</p><table><thead><tr><th>Features</th><th>TikTok</th><th>Triller</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Place Of Origin</td><td>China</td><td>Los Angeles</td></tr><tr><td>Users</td><td>800 million active users, with more than 2 billion downloads</td><td>65 million active users, with more than 250m downloads</td></tr><tr><td>Discover Page</td><td>Trending hashtags, promoted ad campaigns</td><td>Leaderboards, trending hashtags, categorized genre charts, promoted ad campaigns</td></tr><tr><td>Video Duration</td><td>TikTok users can make videos of 15 seconds only</td><td>Triller users can make full music videos to whole tracks</td></tr><tr><td>Video Editing Capabilities</td><td>User-based, ability to add text in particular parts of the clips, range of speeds, effects, overlays, etc.</td><td>A.I.-based, fast motion&#x2F;slow motion, text (basic), overlays</td></tr><tr><td>Music</td><td>Only allows listening to 15-seconds of a song, only lets you use music that is ingested in the app in the videos</td><td>Only allows listen to full songs, can use music that is Triller, Spotify, or Apple Music</td></tr><tr><td>AI Deployment</td><td>Analyzes the users’ preferences and interests through engagement and displays a personalized feed to every user</td><td>Analyzes biometric movements of videos and adapts them to a song’s beat</td></tr><tr><td>Genre</td><td>TikTokers can make videos on any topic, regardless of the genre</td><td>Triller seems to favor EDM and hip-hop</td></tr><tr><td>Sharability</td><td>Can download videos to share to other social networking sites</td><td>Can download videos to share to other social networking sites</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id="How-To-Make-Money-On-The-Two-Apps"><a href="#How-To-Make-Money-On-The-Two-Apps" class="headerlink" title="How To Make Money On The Two Apps?"></a>How To Make Money On The Two Apps?</h2><p>Amid Triller vs. TikTok, the hunt for the better social video platform is on. Although TikTok’s fate in the US is still hanging on the balance, its popularity and usage still continue to sky-rocket in other territories.</p><p>Wondering if you should really switch to Triller or stick with TikTok, for now, to show off your brand? Read on for a quick review.</p><p><strong>Triller vs. TikTok: For Marketing Influencers</strong></p><p>TikTok is undoubtedly a better social video platform for marketing influencers worldwide in terms of reach. Wondering why? Well, in comparison to Triller’s 65m, TikTok has 800 million active users. Moreover, unlike Triller that’s available only in 50 countries, TikTok is available in 155 countries. Also, TikTok has successfully launched a generation of influencers who had started as non-celebrities.</p><p><strong>Triller vs. TikTok: For Brand Building</strong></p><p>Leveraging TikTok can be the key to increasing social brand awareness. This is because with TikTok’s audience growing BY every second, you can use the platform to build your brand. Triller also gives brands a great platform for increasing exposure and get a better share of voice on social media. Just like TikTok, Triller is a fun way for brands to promote their products in their video content.</p><p><strong>Triller vs. TikTok: For Advertising</strong></p><p>TikTok provides advertisers with several options to reach their target demographic. When TikTokers open the app, ads appear and take over the screen completely for a few seconds before it turns into an in-feed video ad. From ad creation and targeting to insight reports and ad management tools, TikTok ads offer an easy-to-use and powerful platform for businesses to advertise. On the other hand, Triller doesn’t include ads currently. Instead, it focuses on letting creators raise money from followers and advertisers as well as crowdfund.</p><p><strong>Triller vs. TikTok: For Content Creators</strong></p><p>To choose the better platform between Triller and TikTok, consider asking yourself a few questions like – What kind of content creators are you creating? Do you spend more time in conceptualizing the message of your video? Would you rather simplify the editing process or have greater flexibility in editing?</p><p>While TikTok features a range of editing tools to give content creators the flexibility of creating the content they want, Triller deploys AI to edit videos for the creator. So, with Triller, you can simply let artificial intelligence compile the best clips for creating a quality video.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/make-money-on-triller-tiktok.png"                      alt="Make Money On Triller Tiktok"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136616/26400" target="_top" id="2136616">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2136616" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136616/26400"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>source：<a class="link"   href="http://www.startupnews.fyi/" >www.startupnews.fyi <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h3 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h3><p>At a time when the internet is divided on whether they should abandon TikTok, the Trump administration approved a deal for Walmart and Oracle to acquire stakes in the US operations of TikTok, thus postponing the potential ban that was planned due to the national security concerns regarding the Chinese owned company. So, US-based TikTokers can finally sigh in relief.</p><p>In summary, both TikTok and Triller offer incredible value to their expanding user base. While TikTok specifically appears to cater to all kinds of publishers and creators, Triller is specifically focused on the artists in the music industry. Videos are all about people smiling, dancing, and having a great time. So, instead of being stressed, get creative and have as much fun as possible!</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg"                      alt="author avatar"                ></p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://bluettide.pxf.io/c/5597632/2141684/17092" target="_top" id="2141684">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/17092-2141684" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="120" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://bluettide.pxf.io/i/5597632/2141684/17092"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><p>Shanoon Cox</p><p>Shanoon Cox is a writer and a lover of all things video.</p><p>Follow @Shanoon Cox</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"      style="display:block"      data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"      data-ad-slot="8358498916"      data-ad-format="auto"      data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-collaborative-sing-along-tiktok-feature/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Collaborative Sing-Along TikTok Feature</u></a></li><li><a href="https://screen-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-secrets-to-proficient-mobile-and-desktop-film-recording/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Secrets to Proficient Mobile and Desktop Film Recording</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-from-still-image-to-live-feed-going-live-on-tiktok-via-computer/"><u>[New] In 2024, From Still Image to Live Feed Going Live on TikTok Via Computer</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-unlocking-the-mystery-of-pfp-a-tiktok-perspective/"><u>[New] In 2024, Unlocking the Mystery of 'PFP' A TikTok Perspective</u></a></li><li><a href="https://vp-tips.techidaily.com/new-in-2024-visuals-vault-uploading-to-ig/"><u>[New] In 2024, Visuals Vault Uploading to IG</u></a></li><li><a href="https://facebook-video-footage.techidaily.com/new-laughter-lane-navigating-to-the-top-15-funny-youtubers/"><u>[New] Laughter Lane Navigating to the Top 15 Funny YouTubers</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/new-photoshop-tutorial-creating-3d-text-illusions/"><u>[New] Photoshop Tutorial Creating 3D Text Illusions</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-elevating-your-macs-tiktok-opener-quality/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Elevating Your Mac's TikTok Opener Quality</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-2024-approved-gastronomic-globe-trotting-iconic-recipes-worldwide/"><u>[Updated] 2024 Approved Gastronomic Globe-Trotting Iconic Recipes Worldwide</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-in-2024-maximize-saving-tiktok-videos-android-and-ios-hacks/"><u>[Updated] In 2024, Maximize Saving TikTok Videos Android & iOS Hacks</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-increase-your-social-media-reach-with-these-top-30-tiktok-nicknames/"><u>[Updated] Increase Your Social Media Reach with These Top 30 TikTok Nicknames</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/2024-approved-trailblazing-tiktok-profile-features-to-become-iconic/"><u>2024 Approved Trailblazing TikTok Profile Features to Become Iconic</u></a></li><li><a href="https://apple-account.techidaily.com/apple-id-unlock-on-apple-iphone-6-plus-how-to-fix-it-by-drfone-ios/"><u>Apple ID Unlock On Apple iPhone 6 Plus?

Such provisions have stirred fierce competition among influencers, for what seems like the Wars of Creativity to publish more and more viral-worthy videos.</p><p>If you are an influencer looking for new and amazing <strong>TikTok ideas</strong> to make your videos go viral, then here is a stimulus.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: TikTok vs YouTube</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers</a></li></ul><h2 id="TikTok-vs-YouTube"><a href="#TikTok-vs-YouTube" class="headerlink" title="TikTok vs YouTube"></a>TikTok vs YouTube</h2><p>TikTok may be one of a kind, but it is not the only platform where you can publish your mobile-made videos without much ado. The protagonist of that story is still, YouTube. TikTok being a game-changer in the scene, is giving maximum competition to all other social networks and digital platforms that deal with video-sharing, such as Instagram, Twitter, or Facebook. But the tiff between YouTube and TikTok surpasses all other competitions because only these two are all about Videos.</p><h4 id="Nature-of-Content"><a href="#Nature-of-Content" class="headerlink" title="Nature of Content"></a>Nature of Content</h4><p>The main difference between YouTube and TikTok is the nature of the content. YouTube is a broader spectrum than TikTok, for it contains feature-length movies, episodes of off-air Television Series, music videos, podcasts, and personal videos is just a part of it. But TikTok revolves around short video clips. And just that.</p><h4 id="User-Base"><a href="#User-Base" class="headerlink" title="User Base"></a>User Base</h4><p>TikTok has a niche user base, with the majority of users between 16 and 25 yo. Meanwhile, YouTube reserves a universal user base, catering to people of all ages and from different walks of life.</p><h4 id="Outreach"><a href="#Outreach" class="headerlink" title="Outreach"></a>Outreach</h4><p>TikTok is primarily a casual, youth-centric platform. While it is useful for highlighting one’s talent and engaging a loyal fanbase, it is not ideal for business promotion, or to present a show in a traditional way, which is a substantial offering of YouTube. But on the flip side, due to the vastness of YouTube, short and casual videos like the ones typically available in TikTok, have limited scope to go viral.</p><p>Therefore, the difference between TikTok and YouTube is like Apples and Oranges. They are both fruits and are sweet. But are different species with different tastes.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/c/5597632/1997695/19272" target="_top" id="1997695">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/19272-1997695" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://aligracehair.sjv.io/i/5597632/1997695/19272"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h2 id="Top-10-TikTok-Video-Ideas-to-Boost-More-Followers"><a href="#Top-10-TikTok-Video-Ideas-to-Boost-More-Followers" class="headerlink" title="Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers"></a>Top 10 TikTok Video Ideas to Boost More Followers</h2><h4 id="1-Music-Videos"><a href="#1-Music-Videos" class="headerlink" title="1.

These songs can be typically found in the trending section of the app and it does not take much effort to figure out the ones that are high in popularity. The catch here is that you need to be among the frontrunners in terms of covering these songs so that you can find yourself a large captive audience to influence at the earliest.</p><p>Here is an example of <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsPbFnhZQ/" >a girl showing off her TikTok music video skills <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h4 id="2-Dance-Videos"><a href="#2-Dance-Videos" class="headerlink" title="2. Dance Videos"></a>2. Dance Videos</h4><p>If it is short, funny, and uses the correct hashtags, your dance video can create a lot of influence among your followers. Oh, and don’t forget to pair them up with the correct background score. A song that is already trending and popular on the social platform will only boost your video’s chances of a hit. A short and easy dance always does the business, even better if it can be used for a meme.</p><p>This is a good example of what <a class="link"   href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BzQsN-RFmQn/" >your dance video should look like <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

Calming Videos</h4><p>Just because it’s a TikTok video doesn’t mean that it has to be over-the-top and loud. Sometimes, keeping things simple is the secret to success. Calming videos are those where something that most would otherwise consider weird or mundane exerts a feeling of calm on the viewer. Most social media platforms have helped such videos gain immense popularity but finding the right explanation of what these pertain to is a pretty difficult task.</p><p>Look at this video of <a class="link"   href="https://in.pinterest.com/pin/705446729114378862/" >color droplets being sprayed from the tip of a brush <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.
