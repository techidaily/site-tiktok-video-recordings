At the moment TikTok is one of the best video sharing platforms for aspiring music video producers because it has more than 500 million active monthly users.</p><p>While joining the TikTok’s community and creating your own account is a simple process, deleting an account is a bit more complicated. The lack of privacy settings is often the reason why the app’s users are choosing to delete their accounts permanently.

However, the recent introduction of the <strong>‘Thinking about removing your account’</strong> option has made this task much quicker. Here’s how you can delete a TikTok account permanently in just a few easy steps.</p><h4 id="Step-1"><a href="#Step-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1"></a>Step 1</h4><p>You must first <strong>add a phone number</strong> to a TikTok account before you can proceed to delete it. After you’ve launched the app, click on the <strong>Profile Information</strong> icon in the lower right corner of the app’s window. Tap on the <strong>Settings option</strong> and then select the <strong>Privacy and Settings feature</strong> from the menu that pops up on the screen. Choose the <strong>Manage my Account</strong> option from the Settings menu, then locate the <strong>Phone Number feature</strong> and tap on it to insert your phone number. The app will send a <strong>one-time password (OTP)</strong> to your phone, so you just have to enter the <strong>verification code</strong> into the appropriate box, and your phone will be connected to your TikTok account.</p><h4 id="Step-2"><a href="#Step-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 2"></a>Step 2</h4><p>Afterward, you should once again tap on the <strong>Profile Information</strong> icon in the lower right corner.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-tiktok-account-1.jpg"                      alt="delete TikTok account "                ></p><p>Once the new window opens, hit the <strong>Settings icon.</strong></p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/how-to-delete-tiktok-account-2.jpg"                      alt="delete TikTok account "                ></p><p>A pop-up menu will appear on the screen, proceed to select the <strong>Privacy and Settings</strong> option.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-tiktok-account-permanently-3.jpg"                      alt="delete TikTok account "                ></p><p>The <strong>Privacy and Settings</strong> dialogue box will appear on the screen and you should tap on the <strong>Manage My Account</strong> option, which is located at the top of the list.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-tiktok-account-4.jpg"                      alt="delete TikTok account "                ></p><p>Locate the <strong>Thinking about removing your account</strong> feature, then tap on it and the app will send an OTP message to your phone automatically.</p><h4 id="Step-3"><a href="#Step-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 3"></a>Step 3</h4><p>Insert the <strong>verification code</strong> you received in the OTP message into the appropriate box and hit the <strong>Continue button</strong> to complete the process of deleting your TikTok account.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/delete-tiktok-account-permanently-5.jpg"                      alt="delete TikTok account "                ></p><p>Keep in mind that your account cannot be recovered once it is deleted and that all information that wasn’t saved on it such as chat messages is going to remain visible to other users of the TikTok platform after you deactivate your account.</p><h2 id="Think-Twice-Before-Deleting-Your-Account"><a href="#Think-Twice-Before-Deleting-Your-Account" class="headerlink" title="Think Twice Before Deleting Your Account"></a>Think Twice Before Deleting Your Account</h2><p>If you don’t want to lose all the videos you shared on TikTok you should download them from your profile to your phone because all the data that was stored on your account is going to be deleted. What’s more, you will not receive a refund for any in-app purchases you made while you were using TikTok. If you would only like to go on a social media hiatus for a while, the app offers some advanced options that will enable you to keep your account while remaining completely invisible on the platform. Here are some of the solutions you might want to consider before deciding to delete your TikTok account forever.</p><h2 id="3-Alternatives-to-Deleting-a-TikTok-Account"><a href="#3-Alternatives-to-Deleting-a-TikTok-Account" class="headerlink" title="3 Alternatives to Deleting a TikTok Account"></a>3 Alternatives to Deleting a TikTok Account</h2><p>The platform offers several advanced options to its users that enable them to be hidden from the public eye. That’s why you don’t have to deactivate your TikTok account if you don’t want your music videos to be accessible to other users of the platform. Here are a few alternative options you have at your disposal.</p><h4 id="Set-Privacy-Settings-to-Private"><a href="#Set-Privacy-Settings-to-Private" class="headerlink" title="Set Privacy Settings to Private"></a>Set Privacy Settings to Private</h4><p>The TikTok app can be used in <strong>Private mode,</strong> even though all accounts on the platform are <strong>Public</strong> when you first create them. All new followers will have to send you a friend request in order to view your videos once you switch to private mode, which enables you to control who can see the content you share on your account. This option can be activated by heading over to the <strong>Settings menu</strong> and choosing the <strong>Privacy and Safety feature.</strong> Afterward, you just have to toggle the <strong>Private Account option</strong> <strong>on</strong>, and after a short while, only your followers will be able to see the content you post on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Prevent-Other-Users-From-Finding-You"><a href="#Prevent-Other-Users-From-Finding-You" class="headerlink" title="Prevent Other Users From Finding You"></a>Prevent Other Users From Finding You</h4><p>The ‘<strong>Allow others to find me’</strong> option lets you control who can see your profile because if you enable it, your account won’t appear in the friend suggestions other users receive from the platform. You can find this option in the <strong>Privacy and Safety menu</strong>, so you can just switch it off if it’s enabled by default.

It capitalized on people’s shortened attention spans and focused on short-form videos to provide entertainment. Also, it provided people with an easy road to fame and with a solid side hustle.</p><p>Are you one of those who aspire to be TikTok’s future top-earner? Try making videos using <strong>TikTok video templates</strong>! They’ll allow you to churn out high-quality content faster than the competition.

They can be about different topics, so anyone can make them.</p><p>An important thing creators should know is the dimension of videos.

But what if you run out of ideas?</p><p>That is where TikTok video templates come in. They are ready-to-use assets you can edit and personalize to make original videos quickly.

Let’s have a look:</p><h3 id="1-Tiktok-Video-Requirements"><a href="#1-Tiktok-Video-Requirements" class="headerlink" title="1. Tiktok Video Requirements"></a><strong>1. Tiktok Video Requirements</strong></h3><p>The first and most important thing that you need to know and understand is the requirement of a Tiktok video. The aspect ratio, the dimension, the orientation, and of course, the length!</p><p><strong>Aspect Ratio:</strong> The majority of the people use Tiktok on their smartphones, so the aspect ratio for a Tiktok video should be 9:16 or 1:1 if there are sidebars.</p><p><strong>Dimension:</strong> The recommended dimension for a Tiktok video is 1080 x 1920.</p><p><strong>Video Orientation:</strong> As mentioned earlier, users usually watch Tiktok videos on their smartphones, so a video with a vertical orientation is much easier to watch compared to a video in landscape mode for which one has to tilt their phones.</p><p><strong>Video Length:</strong> Tiktok videos are usually 15 to 60 seconds long depending on the content, but my advice would be to keep them short, as people usually watch shorter videos till the end and might get bored if the video is too long.</p><p><strong>Video File Size:</strong> The file size for iOS devices is 287.6 MB max, and for Android, it is 72 MB.</p><p><strong>Supported Format:</strong> The video format compatible with Tiktok is MP4 and MOV.</p><p>If you keep these basic requirements in mind and make videos that fall within these criteria, I’m sure your videos will be watch-worthy.

Best Practices to Make Successful Tiktok Videos</strong></h3><p>Tiktok video requirements will help you create videos with the perfect orientation, dimension, and aspect ratio. However, if you want to make videos that get millions of views, go viral, and increase your followers, you must know the best practices to make successful Tiktok videos.</p><p>For instance:</p><p><strong>Post Frequently:</strong> If you want to appear on the FYP, you must post often! The more videos you post, the more the chances to come in front of the audience. And, when the audience sees you regularly, they will get acquainted and start following you to see more of your content.</p><p><strong>Follow the Trends:</strong> Tiktok is all about trends. Something goes viral, and everyone starts making the same content to jump on the bandwagon. The trick is to make the same thing in a unique way. Therefore…</p><p><strong>Be Authentic:</strong> The only way you can be unique is to be authentic, be you! If you keep your originality intact even when following the trend, chances are the audience might just click with your content.</p><p><strong>Choose a Niche:</strong> While, Tiktok is known for having all sorts of video content, ranging from comedy, to sad, to just being motivational, you need to find something you’re good at. For instance, if you can sing well, you can post videos of you singing famous songs. Or, if you can paint well, you can post videos of you painting something. You will reach the right audience, and they will follow you!</p><p>If you ask me, I could watch ASMR cooking videos for hours!</p><h2 id="3-Methods-to-Find-a-Viral-Titok-Topic"><a href="#3-Methods-to-Find-a-Viral-Titok-Topic" class="headerlink" title="3.

Requirements for TikTok Video Cover</strong></h3><p>A thumbnail or video cover is a crucial deciding factor whether to click and watch a TikTok video or not. Therefore, when choosing a cover for your video, make sure it:</p><ul><li>Accurately portrays the content</li><li>Creates excitement among the audience</li><li>Catches their attention</li></ul><p>If you succeed in doing these 3 things, the audience will be definitely compelled to click on your video!</p><h3 id="2-Best-Practices-to-Make-an-Attractive-TikTok-Cover"><a href="#2-Best-Practices-to-Make-an-Attractive-TikTok-Cover" class="headerlink" title="2. Best Practices to Make an Attractive TikTok Cover"></a><strong>2. Best Practices to Make an Attractive TikTok Cover</strong></h3><p>If you want to create an attractive TikTok video cover, here’s what you need to do:</p><p><strong>Include Text:</strong> A title text on the video cover explains the exact purpose of your video. This helps people decide whether they want to consume the content or not.</p><p>For example, if I come across a TikTok video with the title text that says, “5 Tips To Make Your Cat Love You,” I would probably not click on it because I’m not a cat person. However, people with cats would waste no time watching the same video.</p><p>Additionally, a title text can also create a sense of curiosity for the audience and compels them to click and see what happens next. For instance, a TikTok video titled “I Almost Died!” will create suspense, and people will definitely want to know what happened.</p><p><strong>Use a Good Font Style:</strong> I always recommend using a clear, bold font style as it is easy to read. If you use an excessively curvy style or one that does not have clear letters, the audience might have difficulty reading it on the first attempt.</p><p>Also, staying consistent with a specific font style for your thumbnails helps you stand out. People will start recognizing your videos even before looking at the name.</p><p>So, choose your font wisely!</p><p><strong>Use Pleasant-Looking Contrast:</strong> Here, we are referring to the background color and the font color. Make sure they complement each other! If you’re using a light background, make sure the title text font is dark and vice versa.</p><p><strong>Add Few Objects Only:</strong> Make sure your TikTok video cover does not have too many objects in it. Stick to a simple text, an image, and a background. Adding an image, bold font style, bright background, and throwing in a couple of stickers may give a cluttered look. The trick is to keep it simple and neat.</p><p>With that sorted, let me show a few examples of TikTok video covers that successfully do the trick!</p><h2 id="3-Best-Examples-for-TikTok-Video-Cover"><a href="#3-Best-Examples-for-TikTok-Video-Cover" class="headerlink" title="3.

Best Examples for Tiktok Videos"></a><strong>4. Best Examples for Tiktok Videos</strong></h2><p>So, what kind of videos should you make to get to the top on Tiktok? Here are a few examples:</p><p><strong>Challenges:</strong> One way to create a viral video is to go for social media challenges. People come up with challenge videos every now and then, and the whole world gets into the groove, like that ice bucket challenge from 2014 or the Cotton Eyed Joe challenge from 2021.</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKavSXN/" >https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKavSXN/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Dance Videos:</strong> Social media challenges are one thing, but viral dance videos take the fun to the next level. So, if you think you can dance, and add a bit of creativity to it, make a dance challenge video. If you’re good at it, you’ll definitely gain some followers.</p><p><strong>Lip Sync Videos:</strong> Another way to go viral on Tiktok is to make lip-sync videos. The trick is to see who can do it without messing up the lyrics. Like this viral song “Already Best Friends” by Sagittarius Kween:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKanPpe/" >https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKanPpe/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Art Videos:</strong> If you can make art, you can go viral in no time! Take out those paints, colors, and pens, and create a time-lapse painting! Something like this:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKab37F/" >https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKab37F/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Satisfying ASMR Videos:</strong> Satisfying ASMR videos are getting increasingly popular. And, by getting a decent noise-canceling mic, you can easily create such videos and increase your followers.</p><p>Like this kinetic sand ASMR video:</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKmhDyT/" >https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKmhDyT/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p><strong>Makeup Videos:</strong> Makeup tutorials are not only taking over Tiktok but they can be found on other social media platforms as well, with insane followers and subscribers! If you have the knack to create unique looks with makeup, try your hand at this!</p><p><a class="link"   href="https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKmxt1V/" >https://vm.tiktok.com/ZSeKmxt1V/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><p>These are just examples of the kind of videos that get viral on Tiktok. If you have skills similar to the videos mentioned above, or if you have any other skill for that matter, get on Tiktok, make a video, and get famous!</p><h2 id="Tiktok-Video-Caption-3"><a href="#Tiktok-Video-Caption-3" class="headerlink" title="Tiktok Video Caption"></a><strong>Tiktok Video Caption</strong></h2><p>Once you have created an engaging Tiktok video, the next part is to write an attractive caption for it.</p><h3 id="1-Best-Practices-to-Write-Attractive-Tiktok-Captions-3"><a href="#1-Best-Practices-to-Write-Attractive-Tiktok-Captions-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Best Practices to Write Attractive Tiktok Captions"></a><strong>1. Best Practices to Write Attractive Tiktok Captions</strong></h3><p>Here are some tips to help your videos go viral due to the captions:</p><p><strong>Quotes:</strong> A caption can be any line that describes the video or a quote just to grab attention. You can use famous quotes or a dialogue that’s trending to make your caption attractive.</p><p><strong>Hashtags:</strong> You can also use viral hashtags in your captions to make your video appear on the FYP or if someone searches for that particular hashtag. Another tip is to use generic hashtags alongside the viral ones, like #Art #Funny #Asmr, etc.</p><p><strong>Mentions:</strong> Mentioning famous Tiktok accounts in your caption can also make people watch your video.</p><p><strong>Emojis:</strong> Using emojis in the caption is a good idea to grab attention and make it worth reading.</p><p>We’re done with how to make watch-worthy Tiktok videos and add engaging captions. But did you know that the video cover also plays an essential role in getting more views?</p><h2 id="Tiktok-Video-Cover-3"><a href="#Tiktok-Video-Cover-3" class="headerlink" title="Tiktok Video Cover"></a><strong>Tiktok Video Cover</strong></h2><p>Like influencers use catchy thumbnails for their YouTube videos; similarly, TikTok videos also have video covers. So, what should one do to make an attractive TikTok cover?</p><h3 id="1-Requirements-for-TikTok-Video-Cover-3"><a href="#1-Requirements-for-TikTok-Video-Cover-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Requirements for TikTok Video Cover"></a><strong>1. Requirements for TikTok Video Cover</strong></h3><p>A thumbnail or video cover is a crucial deciding factor whether to click and watch a TikTok video or not. Therefore, when choosing a cover for your video, make sure it:</p><ul><li>Accurately portrays the content</li><li>Creates excitement among the audience</li><li>Catches their attention</li></ul><p>If you succeed in doing these 3 things, the audience will be definitely compelled to click on your video!</p><h3 id="2-Best-Practices-to-Make-an-Attractive-TikTok-Cover-3"><a href="#2-Best-Practices-to-Make-an-Attractive-TikTok-Cover-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Best Practices to Make an Attractive TikTok Cover"></a><strong>2. Best Practices to Make an Attractive TikTok Cover</strong></h3><p>If you want to create an attractive TikTok video cover, here’s what you need to do:</p><p><strong>Include Text:</strong> A title text on the video cover explains the exact purpose of your video. This helps people decide whether they want to consume the content or not.</p><p>For example, if I come across a TikTok video with the title text that says, “5 Tips To Make Your Cat Love You,” I would probably not click on it because I’m not a cat person. However, people with cats would waste no time watching the same video.</p><p>Additionally, a title text can also create a sense of curiosity for the audience and compels them to click and see what happens next. For instance, a TikTok video titled “I Almost Died!” will create suspense, and people will definitely want to know what happened.</p><p><strong>Use a Good Font Style:</strong> I always recommend using a clear, bold font style as it is easy to read. If you use an excessively curvy style or one that does not have clear letters, the audience might have difficulty reading it on the first attempt.</p><p>Also, staying consistent with a specific font style for your thumbnails helps you stand out. People will start recognizing your videos even before looking at the name.</p><p>So, choose your font wisely!</p><p><strong>Use Pleasant-Looking Contrast:</strong> Here, we are referring to the background color and the font color. Make sure they complement each other! If you’re using a light background, make sure the title text font is dark and vice versa.</p><p><strong>Add Few Objects Only:</strong> Make sure your TikTok video cover does not have too many objects in it. Stick to a simple text, an image, and a background. Adding an image, bold font style, bright background, and throwing in a couple of stickers may give a cluttered look. The trick is to keep it simple and neat.</p><p>With that sorted, let me show a few examples of TikTok video covers that successfully do the trick!</p><h2 id="3-Best-Examples-for-TikTok-Video-Cover-3"><a href="#3-Best-Examples-for-TikTok-Video-Cover-3" class="headerlink" title="3.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2 id="Reimagining-Anime-Narratives-in-Trending-TikTok-Creations"><a href="#Reimagining-Anime-Narratives-in-Trending-TikTok-Creations" class="headerlink" title="Reimagining Anime Narratives in Trending TikTok Creations"></a>Reimagining Anime Narratives in Trending TikTok Creations</h2><p>TikTok has become an unstoppable source of entertainment. Memes and videos are appealing to watch, although better ones are released virtually every day for inspiration. numerous musicians included as they acquire recognition. Their tunes and hits delighted viewers, and songs earned prominence. Most individuals obtained followers via popular videos that were often featured on the subscribers’ lists. Get inspired by the newest <strong>anime TikTok</strong> trends and discover how to spot upcoming trends to boost your company or personal account.</p><p>Something that appears perennially groovy one moment might be insufferable the next — like, say, wearing fedoras or Kreepa’s <strong>anime TikTok</strong> “Oh No.” Every second, new trend is forming, and old ones are fading. It’s the cycle of life. If you’re seeking inspiration, read on: we’ve put up a guide to the finest TikTok trends of 2022. So how can we stay up with the current TikTok trends? How do we remain hip? A TikTok trend might be music, hashtag, dance, or challenge. Even how you modify your <strong>TikTok anime</strong> might become a trend like a fancy transition style. Once a <strong>TikTok anime</strong> trend begins to gather hold, people “hop on” it by duplicating a current TikTok video or theme.</p><h2 id="Top-20-TikTok-Anime-Idea"><a href="#Top-20-TikTok-Anime-Idea" class="headerlink" title="Top 20 TikTok Anime Idea"></a>Top 20 TikTok Anime Idea</h2><p>Brace yourself for the upcoming listicle. It contains all about TikTok Anime ideas; dances, songs, memes, and filters. Let’s find out one-by-one:</p><h3 id="Let’s-Groove"><a href="#Let’s-Groove" class="headerlink" title="Let’s Groove:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/lets-groove-jojo" >Let’s Groove: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>This is another one of those TikTok trends where individuals show off their talents by dancing to trendy songs or music, which in this instance is a song called “Lets Groove” by an American band named “Earth Wind &amp; Fire“. This trend began when TikToker @absolutesnacc used a remix of Lets Groove to build a fan edit montage incorporating footage of actor Jason Segel from the TV program named “Freaks and Geeks”.</p><h3 id="Trending-dances"><a href="#Trending-dances" class="headerlink" title="Trending dances:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/anime-dance?lang=en" >Trending dances: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>TikTok is recognized for artists who know their movements — and in reality, many of the highest-earning TikTokers are dancers. But due to trendy dances, you don’t have to be an expert to perform the correct choreography. TikTok dances are generally short, pleasant, and entry-level, so amateurs may learn them with minimal effort. This offers a lot of flexibility for putting your twist on it—for example, ripping up the floor in a giant teddy bear costume.</p><h3 id="Prada-Bucket-challenge"><a href="#Prada-Bucket-challenge" class="headerlink" title="Prada Bucket challenge:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/prada-challenge?lang=en" >Prada Bucket challenge: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>This TikTok fad is particular to the richer portion of the community, as artists join in this challenge to flaunt their costly attire when sporting a 600$ Prada Bucket hat, thus the name “Prada Bucket challenge”. Participants start by pretending to be “upset” about something, so they put their Prada Bucket hats on, and with some film editing magic, their clothing converts into more costly clothes.</p><h3 id="Glow-ups"><a href="#Glow-ups" class="headerlink" title="Glow-ups:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/biggest-anime-glow-ups?lang=en" >Glow-ups: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>At its essence, a glow-up on TikTok is a “before” and “after.” Many artists may submit a few photographs or films depicting themselves as an awkward adolescent, then a last, contemporary clip. Glow-ups also work excellent for encouraging positive interaction. (Usually, one when they appear confident and amazing). These sorts of TikToks are wonderful for the wait-for-it factor: consumers are more willing to watch the complete video to see the finished product.</p><h3 id="Anime-Edits"><a href="#Anime-Edits" class="headerlink" title="Anime Edits:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/edits-anime?lang=en" >Anime Edits: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>If you’re an anime geek you’ve probably already heard about this trend when producers build a montage utilizing clips from their favorite anime series and add some background music simply to liven things up. Although this trend has been going on for a long now, it still doesn’t seem old since the anime fans have been keeping it alive. So, it doesn’t matter whether you enjoy Initial D or Naruto, this trend is relevant to all anime viewers.</p><h3 id="Edgy-humor"><a href="#Edgy-humor" class="headerlink" title="Edgy humor:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/edgy-humor" >Edgy humor: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>There’s a reason why TikTok is so popular with the under-30 crowd: the brief videos and highly scrollable characteristics of the app make it excellent for comedy, snark, and sass. And although many content producers and skilled social media marketers have discovered ways to convert TikTok into a business, the platform’s core aim is to “inspire creativity and generate joy.” So don’t take it too seriously. The edgier, the better.</p><h3 id="Making-TikToks-with-Your-Family"><a href="#Making-TikToks-with-Your-Family" class="headerlink" title="Making TikToks with Your Family:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/Making-an-anime-family" >Making TikToks with Your Family: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>This goes hand in hand with being vulnerable and genuine—there’s nothing quite like a nice cameo from Mom, Dad, Grandma, or Grandpa. Because so many TikTok producers are millennials or Gen Z, it’s refreshing (and enjoyable) to see older folks on the platform. The difficult part of this is encouraging your family to join, but if you’ve got one excellent sport, you’ve hit gold. For example, simply try to watch this family dancing blooper without your heartbreak.</p><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/c/5597632/2120865/26400?prodsku=mercury" target="_top" id="2120865">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/26400-2120865" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ephamedtechinc.pxf.io/i/5597632/2120865/26400?prodsku=mercury"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end --><h3 id="Baked-Feta-Pasta"><a href="#Baked-Feta-Pasta" class="headerlink" title="Baked Feta Pasta:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/Baked-Feta-Pasta" >Baked Feta Pasta: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>This is a TikTok trend for all those foodies out there who enjoy delicious spaghetti with some cheese. This practice grew so prevalent that the grocery shops in Finland faced a scarcity of feta cheese. The technique of creating this pasta is straightforward, start by adding some cherry tomatoes and garlic in an oven-safe dish, sprinkle some salt, pepper, and Italian seasoning, and pour some olive oil before combining the ingredients. Place a block of Feta cheese in the middle and bake in the oven until soft, compress the contents to make a paste, and combine with your favorite Pasta, that’s it! Your Baked Feta Pasta is ready to be served.</p><h3 id="Seamless-Transitions"><a href="#Seamless-Transitions" class="headerlink" title="Seamless Transitions:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/anime-smooth-transitions" >Seamless Transitions: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Another aspect that’s unique to TikTok is the transitions inside movies. The in-app editing tools make it simple to flip from one clip to another in a manner that appears like magic. This might be as basic as keeping your illumination the same and maintaining your camera in the same location. They may also be more sophisticated. Think spinning your camera about, putting your phone on the ground, zooming in and out – honestly, the sky’s the limit. When someone truly nails a transition, it’s virtually hard to view the video just once.</p><h3 id="Pet-Painting"><a href="#Pet-Painting" class="headerlink" title="Pet Painting:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/pet-painting?lang=en" >Pet Painting: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>This TikTok craze is a wonderful way to have your fuzzy companion included in one of your videos. No, you don’t paint a portrait of your pet, your pet performs the painting portion, how you may ask? it’s fairly easy, all you need is a canvas, some liquid colors of your choosing, a huge plastic bag, and a pet, of course, you will also need a paste-like food that your pet enjoys, peanut butter for instance. Start by covering the canvas with the plastic bag and spread peanut butter on the section covering the canvas, gently remove the canvas from the bag and keep the plastic aside.</p><h3 id="Referencing-Modern-Pop-Culture"><a href="#Referencing-Modern-Pop-Culture" class="headerlink" title="Referencing Modern Pop Culture:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/anime-references?lang=en" >Referencing Modern Pop Culture: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Score some likes, comments, and shares by tapping into an already-huge fan following. Trending TV series and movies frequently inspire their TikTok trends. When Squid Game dominated the globe in 2021, it prompted suspense-making instructions, musical mashups, and many tracksuits. This is just one of the millions of instances of how inventive TikTok fans addressed the program.</p><h3 id="Satisfying-Videos"><a href="#Satisfying-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Satisfying Videos:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/satisfying-anime-cooking?lang=en" >Satisfying Videos: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>This simply possibly be the most widely accepted and least contentious genre ever: the enjoyable video. Like the day-in-the-life films, they are a celebration of the commonplace. So, the likelihood is, you’re already doing something pleasurable to watch. Whether its soap cutting or cake frosting or freezing bubbles, there’s something very relaxing and fulfilling about this type of material.</p><h3 id="Passing-the-Phone"><a href="#Passing-the-Phone" class="headerlink" title="Passing the Phone:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/pass-the-phone-challenge?lang=en" >Passing the Phone: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>We’re going to top things off with another TikTok trend, this one is a fun way of roasting your friends or family members and, of course, getting them involved in your TikToks. The way these trend works is really simple, you just call out your friend by making funny comments about certain bad habits or characteristics they have and then pass the phone to them because it’s their turn to do the same, so it’s just a series of taking turns roasting your friends and the best part is that there is no limit to how many people can participate.</p><h3 id="Challenge-Freezing-Honey"><a href="#Challenge-Freezing-Honey" class="headerlink" title="Challenge: Freezing Honey"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/Frozen-honey?lang=en" >Challenge: Freezing Honey <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Another TikTok food craze is gaining traction, and it’s safe to assume that Honey is involved. One of the easiest fads to adopt is the freezing honey TikTok craze; everyone has honey and, of course, a freezer. This challenge calls for 100 percent pure honey, since non-pure honey may crystallize at low temperatures. If your honey comes in a plastic bottle, chuck it in the freezer; if it comes in a jar, pour it into a plastic container and remove any lids or bottle tops before freezing, since these may be difficult to remove after freezing.</p><h3 id="Documenting-a-Day-in-The-Life"><a href="#Documenting-a-Day-in-The-Life" class="headerlink" title="Documenting a Day in The Life:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/Documenting-Life" >Documenting a Day in The Life: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>While grumpy Instagram users may tell you that “no one wants to see your avocado toast,” the truth is that a lot of people do. Many of these films romanticize the mundane, but humor has a place in this medium as well. If you’re a creative who gets a lot of questions in the comments section, here is the place to be. Seeing someone’s daily routine, whether it’s a second-grade teacher, a lawyer, or a couple living in a van, is a rewarding experience. Over 2 million people have liked this “actual day in the life of a vehicle.”</p><h3 id="Classical-Challenges"><a href="#Classical-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="Classical Challenges:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/anime-tiktok-challenge?lang=en" >Classical Challenges: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>TikTok thrives on obstacles. For challenges, many TikTok users would all post films aiming to achieve the same thing, like the stair-step challenge, where they would dance up a set of steps in intricate ways. These are generally community-created trends; however, they may take the shape of sponsored hashtags, too. Challenges are a simple way for users on TikTok to feel like they’re part of the community.</p><h3 id="Tell-Me-Without-Telling-Me"><a href="#Tell-Me-Without-Telling-Me" class="headerlink" title="Tell Me Without Telling Me:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/tag/tellmewithouttellingme?lang=en" >Tell Me Without Telling Me: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>The creator begins by saying, “Tell me you drive a fast car without telling me you drive a fast car” and then says, “I’ll go first” to start a streak for other users to follow. Users then proceed to show the engine layout of their vehicle, the exhaust note, or possibly a flyby, so following this trend is a good way to make your TikToks stand out. This TikTok craze is a wonderful way to tell your audience what you’re trying to say or to depict certain occurrences subtly.</p><h3 id="Behind-the-scenes-Videos"><a href="#Behind-the-scenes-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Behind-the-scenes Videos:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/behind-the-scenes-naruto" >Behind-the-scenes Videos: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>We love an inside scoop, and behind-the-scenes films are perfect for teaching and for making viewers feel like they’re receiving something special. If you’re a creative who generates something tangible (like art, cuisine, or fashion) and advertises it on TikTok, a behind-the-scenes film might give your brand an added depth. You can even produce a behind-the-scenes TikTok describing how you made a TikTok. Ontario, California-based Logan’s candies attracted five and a half million followers by releasing TikToks depicting how their sweets were made—it’s a very interesting process.</p><h3 id="Love-Nwantiti-Dance"><a href="#Love-Nwantiti-Dance" class="headerlink" title="Love Nwantiti Dance:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/nwantiti-anime?lang=en" >Love Nwantiti Dance: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>The Love Nwantiti Dance is a dance that is performed by people who love one another. If you like dancing and music, you may try filming a TikTok dance video to capitalize on this trend. Love Nwantiti is a song by CKay, a Nigerian singer and songwriter who goes by the alias “CKay.” The phrase “Nwantiti” means “little love” in Igbo. This is one of those TikTok trends where content producers flash their skills by dancing to hot music or songs, in this instance a tune named “Love Nwantiti.” It is more popular with young people.</p><h3 id="Hashtags-with-Challenges"><a href="#Hashtags-with-Challenges" class="headerlink" title="Hashtags with Challenges:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/anime-challenge?lang=en" >Hashtags with Challenges: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>Many videos will frequently add a #ForYou hashtag to be featured on the page. Just like any other app, getting to the main page is key to landing a popular TikTok video and collecting new followers. Considering TikTok is starting to look at advertising directly in the app, revenue for TikTokers isn’t far off, and leveraging hashtags to trick the system is important to gaining viewers. TikTok virtually runs on hashtags. It’s what makes the app so entertaining. Everything is shared, and everyone is encouraged to join in. Clicking on hashtags, particularly ones that are developed around challenges, is a simple method to find what others are using to get to the ‘For You’ area.</p><h3 id="Learn-on-TikTok"><a href="#Learn-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Learn on TikTok:"></a><a class="link"   href="https://www.tiktok.com/discover/learn-the-alphabet-with-anime?lang=en" >Learn on TikTok: <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></h3><p>This TikTok trend is a spectacular method for creators to share their ideas, talents, and life hacks and a chance for viewers to expand their knowledge on particular subjects and discover new items that may aid them in their day-to-day lives.

Regardless, if you find <strong>anime TikTok</strong> cringeworthy and strange, that’s probably because you grew up in the period before the social web. Generation Z’s enjoy the funny internet sharing platform and many now earn money from it. It’s easy, hilarious, and irreverent - and a pleasant change of pace from more serious networks such as Twitter and Facebook. It’s the perfect procrastination app that can lure you in for hours.

For iPhone users, Siri is not new. Siri helps them read text messages and much more, but soon after the text-to-speech feature was added in TikTok, it took the TikTokers world by storm. But since the voice sounded so much like Siri, people started calling it Siri voice rather than text-to-speech. This feature allows users to convert any text into a speech using an automated voice. And if you have never used the text-to-speech feature, this post will help you understand <strong>how to do the Siri voice on TikTok.</strong></p><h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">What is Siri Voice?</a></p><p>02 <a href="#part2">How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?</a></p><p>03 <a href="#part3">TikTok Voice Changer Apps</a></p><h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Siri-Voice"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Siri-Voice" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Siri Voice?"></a>Part 1: What is Siri Voice?</h2><p>Siri voice in TikTok is basically an automated voice feature where the voice reads out the text on the video. The feature is called text-to-speech. So, whenever you enable it on your video, the text will be read out loud, which makes the video watching experience fun. Therefore, those who want to add a voice to their TikTok videos can use the text-to-speech feature and let the automated voice do that talking.</p><p>You will find almost everyone using it, even those who often use their voice in TikTok videos, and that’s because many TikTok users find it entertaining and funny. Well, no matter why you want to use this feature, find out <strong>how to do Siri voice on TikTok</strong> without any hassle in the next part!</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Do-Siri-Voice-on-TikTok"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Do-Siri-Voice-on-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?"></a>Part 2: How to Do Siri Voice on TikTok?</h2><p>To do Siri voice on TikTok, you will have to follow just a few simple steps.

Try These TikTok Voice Changer Apps</h2><p>If you are not impressed with the Siri voice on TikTok and would instead like to use some other fun and peppy voice for the text, the good news is there are tons of apps that can help you do that. But before we share the names of the apps, let’s throw some light on why people are looking for such apps. First, if you are using TikTok’s text-to-speech feature in North America, you will hear a computer-automated female voice who will read out the text of the video.</p><p>But, when it comes to the UK, the app uses a computer-generated male voice with a rockin’ accent instead of a female voice. However, recently the voiceover artist of the female voice has filed a lawsuit against the company, saying that she never permitted TikTok to use her voice for text-to-speech, which is why TikTok is now using a cheerful valley girl voice for the text-to-speech feature. Unfortunately, TikTok users are not happy with the new voice, making them look for the best TikTok voice generator apps.</p><p>If you also want to add another voice for the text-to-speech, here are our hand-picked top and best 5 TikTok voice generator apps for iOS and Android.</p><h3 id="1-Voice-Changer"><a href="#1-Voice-Changer" class="headerlink" title="1.

Try These TikTok Voice Changer Apps</h2><p>If you are not impressed with the Siri voice on TikTok and would instead like to use some other fun and peppy voice for the text, the good news is there are tons of apps that can help you do that. But before we share the names of the apps, let’s throw some light on why people are looking for such apps. First, if you are using TikTok’s text-to-speech feature in North America, you will hear a computer-automated female voice who will read out the text of the video.</p><p>But, when it comes to the UK, the app uses a computer-generated male voice with a rockin’ accent instead of a female voice. However, recently the voiceover artist of the female voice has filed a lawsuit against the company, saying that she never permitted TikTok to use her voice for text-to-speech, which is why TikTok is now using a cheerful valley girl voice for the text-to-speech feature. Unfortunately, TikTok users are not happy with the new voice, making them look for the best TikTok voice generator apps.</p><p>If you also want to add another voice for the text-to-speech, here are our hand-picked top and best 5 TikTok voice generator apps for iOS and Android.</p><h3 id="1-Voice-Changer-3"><a href="#1-Voice-Changer-3" class="headerlink" title="1.

Also, remember that these tools are not in any way associated with Tik Tok officially. Instead, they act as supportive platforms for calculation.</p><h4 id="1-Tik-Tok-Influencer-Earnings-Calculator"><a href="#1-Tik-Tok-Influencer-Earnings-Calculator" class="headerlink" title="1.

However, their project of biddable ads is in progress. It will be launched soon after completion. What brands search for are different influencers either according to the niche or growth of a particular Tik Tok account. Nowadays, influencers have to contact brands for promotions or stuff like that. So, if you have more count on followers and engagement as an influencer, you would be going to get the right amount on those sponsorships.</p><p>The most important aspect is to calculate the engagement rate. It is because it’s a highly considerable factor brand may look. However, there is no official method to calculate the engagement rate. Most of the published ones are inaccurate. They won’t tell you the correct specs about the percentage of people opening the app once a day. For accuracy concerns, we’ve devised a formula to calculate individual Tik Tok account engagement. The formula states as [No. of hearts + No. of comments]&#x2F; No. of followers] × 100.</p><p><strong>Pros</strong></p><ul><li>Calculates engagement rate</li><li>DIY method</li><li>Zero cost solution</li></ul><p><strong>Cons</strong></p><ul><li>Not super effective</li></ul><h4 id="2-Igface"><a href="#2-Igface" class="headerlink" title="2.

This tiny device (via<a class="link"   href="https://liliputing.com/onexplayer-m1-is-a-mini-pc-with-intel-core-ultra-9-185h-oculink-and-usb4/" >Liliputing <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ) has the Intel Core Ultra 9 185H and up to 32 GB of RAM. It also has an RJ45 port, Wi-Fi 6E, and Bluetooth 5.2, meaning you have three different connectivity options.</p><p> This tiny device has a 200 mm x 120 mm footprint, making it highly portable—it’s so small that you can fit it inside a relatively loose pocket. It also weighs 600 grams, so you don’t have to worry about hurting your back if you want to move your mini-PC.</p><p> However, this small size means that the mini-PC has only limited slots. It can only accommodate a single M.2 2280 SSD and one SODIMM slot so you can say goodbye to the advantages of dual-channel memory.</p><p> Nevertheless, the OneXPlayer M1 does not lack physical ports to connect your devices. It has two USB4 Type-C ports, one USB 3.2 and one USB 2.0 Type-A port, two HDMI ports, one DisplayPort, an RJ45 ethernet jack, a 3.5 mm<a class="link"   href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tag/audio" >audio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> outlet, and a microSD card reader. More importantly, it also comes with an OCuLink port to give you the option to provide it with the graphical oomph of the OneXGPU eGPU.</p><p> LATEST VIDEOS FROM tomshardware Tom’s Hardware</p><p> Image 1 of 5</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="OneXPlayer M1 product images"                ></p><p> (Image credit: One-Netbook)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="OneXPlayer M1 product images"                ></p><p> (Image credit: One-Netbook)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="OneXPlayer M1 product images"                ></p><p> (Image credit: One-Netbook)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="OneXPlayer M1 product images"                ></p><p> (Image credit: One-Netbook)</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/cyclingnews/media/img/missing-image.svg"                      alt="OneXPlayer M1 product images"                ></p><p> (Image credit: One-Netbook)</p><p> Aside from the Power button, One-Netbook also gave its mini-PC an RGB button to adjust the RGB lights on the case. But what’s interesting is that the Turbo button from PCs in the 1980s and 1990s is returning on the OneXPlayer M1. The Turbo button will push the 185H’s power draw from the base 45 to 60 watts — just five watts short of its maximum configurable TDP. A 100-watt USB-C power supply also powers the mini-PC, so you’ll have ample power, even pushing the processor to its limit.</p><p> The OneXPlayer M1 has almost the same shape and size as the OneXGPU, with the external GPU weighing about 250 grams heavier. The latter also features several ports, including two HDMI ports, two DisplayPort outlets, two USB 3.2 Type-A ports, a USB4 Type-C port with 100 watts reverse power delivery, and a gigabit RJ45 port. This makes both devices perfect for each other, allowing you to get a fully featured computer you could put in two pockets.</p><p> Pre-orders for a 32 GB RAM &#x2F; 1 TB SSD OneXPlayer M1 are already in Japan at JPY142,310 (or around $900). But if you bundle it with the OneXGPU, you get a 10% discount on the eGPU. So, if you’re looking for a small PC you can quickly move around but don’t sacrifice performance and graphical power, you should watch out for the OneXPlayer M1 mini-PC.</p><h2 id="Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter"><a href="#Stay-On-the-Cutting-Edge-Get-the-Tom’s-Hardware-Newsletter" class="headerlink" title="Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter"></a>Stay On the Cutting Edge: Get the Tom’s Hardware Newsletter</h2><p> Get Tom’s Hardware’s best news and in-depth reviews, straight to your inbox.</p><p> Contact me with news and offers from other Future brands  Receive email from us on behalf of our trusted partners or sponsors</p><p> By submitting your information you agree to the<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/terms-conditions/" >Terms &amp; Conditions <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and<a class="link"   href="https://futureplc.com/privacy-policy/" >Privacy Policy <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and are aged 16 or over.</p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-format="autorelaxed"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="1223367746"></ins></p><p><ins class="adsbygoogle"     style="display:block"     data-ad-client="ca-pub-7571918770474297"     data-ad-slot="8358498916"     data-ad-format="auto"     data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p><p><span class="atpl-alsoreadstyle">Also read:</span></p><div><ul><li><a href="https://screen-video-capture.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-explore-top-5-ps2-games-simulators-for-ios/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Explore Top 5 PS2 Games Simulators for iOS</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-2024-approved-outshine-competitors-30-best-tiktok-pfp-strategies/"><u>[New] 2024 Approved Outshine Competitors 30 Best TikTok PFP Strategies</u></a></li><li><a href="https://instagram-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-captivating-cycles-on-ig-perfecting-the-boomerang-effect-for-2024/"><u>[New] Captivating Cycles on IG Perfecting the Boomerang Effect for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/new-mastering-the-social-media-game-the-best-30-nicknames-for-tiktok-for-2024/"><u>[New] Mastering the Social Media Game The Best 30 Nicknames for TikTok for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-breaking-free-from-tiktoks-hidden-bans-a-roadmap-for-2024/"><u>[Updated] Breaking Free From TikTok's Hidden Bans A Roadmap for 2024</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/updated-from-ordinary-to-extraordinary-your-pathway-with-tiktok-templates/"><u>[Updated] From Ordinary to Extraordinary Your Pathway with TikTok Templates</u></a></li><li><a href="https://ai-voice.techidaily.com/2024-approved-best-4-morgan-freeman-voice-generator-tools-for-voice-cloning/"><u>2024 Approved Best 4 Morgan Freeman Voice Generator Tools for Voice Cloning</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-location-track.techidaily.com/how-to-track-poco-c65-location-by-number-drfone-by-drfone-virtual-android/"><u>How to Track Poco C65 Location by Number | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://iphone-unlock.techidaily.com/how-to-unlock-stolen-apple-iphone-se-in-different-conditionsin-drfone-by-drfone-ios/"><u>How To Unlock Stolen Apple iPhone SE In Different Conditionsin | Dr.fone</u></a></li><li><a href="https://extra-guidance.techidaily.com/in-2024-navigating-camera-settings-for-optimal-gopro-timelapse-results/"><u>In 2024, Navigating Camera Settings for Optimal GoPro Timelapse Results</u></a></li><li><a href="https://on-screen-recording.techidaily.com/in-2024-quicksnap-pro-studio-tools/"><u>In 2024, QuickSnap Pro Studio Tools</u></a></li><li><a href="https://android-unlock.techidaily.com/in-2024-top-10-password-cracking-tools-for-meizu-21-pro-by-drfone-android/"><u>In 2024, Top 10 Password Cracking Tools For Meizu 21 Pro</u></a></li><li><a href="https://tiktok-video-recordings.techidaily.com/the-template-trick-for-eye-catching-tiktok-creation-mastery/"><u>The Template Trick for Eye-Catching TikTok Creation Mastery</u></a></li><li><a href="https://twitter-videos.techidaily.com/upload-ubiquity-from-twitter-to-snapchat-videos-for-2024/"><u>Upload Ubiquity From Twitter to Snapchat Videos for 2024</u></a></li></ul></div><!-- affiliate ads begin --><a href="https://ursime.pxf.io/c/5597632/2136545/16384" target="_top" id="2136545">  <img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16384-2136545" border="0" alt="https://techidaily.com" width="728" height="90"/></a><img  height="0" width="0"                      lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://ursime.pxf.io/i/5597632/2136545/16384"                      style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0"                 ><!-- affiliate ads end -->]]></content>

Check out below to know more.</p><p>President Donald Trump on August 5, 2020, issued executive orders announcing that he is banning Chinese-owned TikTok from U.S. app stores. The drastic move comes months after the Trump administration first teased the idea of outlawing this immensely popular video-sharing app due to national security concerns.</p><p>U.S. officials are concerned that this Chinese-owned and operated app can potentially pass on US users’ data to the Chinese government. And, with TikTok facing uncertainty in the U.S. between being banned or bought by an American company, many predict Likee may soon surpass TikTok.
