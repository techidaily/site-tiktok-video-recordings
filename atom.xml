Introduced originally for gamers, it now has become a platform for all types of communities who want video calls, voice chats, video streaming, and more.</p><p>It’s arguably one of the best and most popular apps among the global gaming community. Though it’s free to use, you need a paid subscription plan to unlock its full potential like almost all other online services available.</p><p>The premium subscription service for Discord is known as Discord Nitro! Want to learn more about it? Read on as we elaborate.</p><ul><li><a href="#part1">Part 1: What Is Discord Nitro?</a></li><li><a href="#part2">Part 2: Why Should People Use The Discord Nitro?</a></li><li><a href="#part3">Part 3: How Much Does Discord Nitro Cost??</a></li><li><a href="#part4">Part 4: How to Subscribe to Discord Nitro?</a></li><li><a href="#part5">Part 5: How to Get Discord Nitro for Free?</a></li><li><a href="#part6">Part 6: When People should Use Discord Nitro?</a></li></ul><hr><h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-Discord-Nitro-And-What-Does-It-Do"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-Discord-Nitro-And-What-Does-It-Do" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is Discord Nitro And What Does It Do?"></a>Part 1: What Is Discord Nitro And What Does It Do?</h2><p>Discord is absolutely free, but you may require a Discord Nitro subscription if you want to use its more powerful features! At this point, you may be wondering, what does Discord Nitro do?</p><p>Though upgrading is not a requirement as most features do not require a subscription, free users still have certain limitations.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-nitro-pricing.jpg"                      alt="Discord Nitro pricing"                ></p><p>For instance, they can’t use the same emojis on two servers. In addition to that, the streaming quality and account customization features also lack on the free plan. These features and more are strictly for Discord Nitro users only.</p><p>Apart from the fact that Discord Nitro offers better additional features, it also lets users help their preferred servers and unlock various features.</p><h2 id="Part-2-Why-Should-People-Use-The-Discord-Nitro"><a href="#Part-2-Why-Should-People-Use-The-Discord-Nitro" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: Why Should People Use The Discord Nitro?"></a>Part 2: Why Should People Use The Discord Nitro?</h2><p>With the discord free version, you can do many things: <strong>communicate with your friend outside and inside of games, start your server, and even participate in various channels</strong>.</p><p>For some, these features are more than adequate; for others, they aren’t! They want more capabilities, and Discord Nitro provides them exactly with that.</p><p>However, most of these new features are cosmetic.</p><p>For instance, <strong>you can make and use your custom emojis if you’re an emoji admirer. Not only this, but you can also use animated emojis, including GIFs</strong>.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-nitro-benefits.jpg"                      alt="Discord Nitro benefits"                ></p><p>Without further ado, here are a few key benefits you’ll get with Discord Nitro:</p><h3 id="Better-Emojis"><a href="#Better-Emojis" class="headerlink" title="Better Emojis"></a>Better Emojis</h3><p>We all know how vital emojis have become for healthy chitchats, even to the extent that no conversation seems complete if you don’t have an emoji in it.</p><p><strong>Discord Nitro allows you to collect and create your customized emojis</strong>. Usually, these emojis are animated and easily used while chatting with other Discord users.</p><h3 id="Personal-Profile"><a href="#Personal-Profile" class="headerlink" title="Personal Profile"></a>Personal Profile</h3><p>Since your personal profile is your only Discord identity, make sure to customize it with animated avatars and claim custom tags to get going.</p><h3 id="Better-Animation"><a href="#Better-Animation" class="headerlink" title="Better Animation"></a>Better Animation</h3><p>With Discord Nitro, you can also unblock various GIF avatars and custom tags.</p><h3 id="High-Definition-HD-Screen-Sharing"><a href="#High-Definition-HD-Screen-Sharing" class="headerlink" title="High-Definition (HD) Screen Sharing"></a>High-Definition (HD) Screen Sharing</h3><p>You can share the game screen on the server or with friends and other users with Discord Nitro. Choose from 720p and 1080p at 30fps.</p><h3 id="Fancy-Badge"><a href="#Fancy-Badge" class="headerlink" title="Fancy Badge"></a>Fancy Badge</h3><p>One of the better additions for several Discord users is getting the latest, fancy badge. <strong>With Discord Nitro, you can earn new badges to display on your personal profile</strong>.</p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Much-Does-Discord-Nitro-Cost"><a href="#Part-3-How-Much-Does-Discord-Nitro-Cost" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Much Does Discord Nitro Cost?"></a>Part 3: How Much Does Discord Nitro Cost?</h2><p>Free Discord users can choose from two variants if they want to switch to Discord Nitro premium services.</p><p>You can choose between annual or monthly subscription plans. And if you pick a yearly subscription plan, you’ll get a 16% discount.</p><p>The two Discord Nitro variants are Nitro Classic and Nitro!</p><p>If you choose the Nitro classic subscription service, you’ll have to pay $4.99 on the monthly plan or $49.99 annually. This variant is comparatively cheaper than the Nitro and provides stripped-down features.</p><p>On the other hand, if you go for the Nitro subscription service, get ready to pay $99.99 on the yearly plan and $9.99 on the monthly. It offers many features to its users.</p><p>Both these variants provide loads of advantages to discord users; here are a handful of benefits the two paid subscription services offer:</p><ul><li>If you choose the free version, your screen share settings typically max out at the 720p resolution (30fps). However, if you select either of the two paid versions, you can share a screen with friends at 720p (60fps) resolution or 1080p resolution (30fps)</li><li>Go-Live provides users with limited streaming; it means you can stream games to users who don’t happen to be your friends, unlike screen-share. So, with a free version, you can stream at 720p (30fps), whereas, Nitro Classic subscription will allow you to stream up to 1080p resolution (60fps), and the Nitro will provide you with 60fps and more quality</li><li>With the free version, you can upload and share only 8MB size files. But with paid variants, you’ll get an increased uploading limit. For example, Nitro Classic allows an upload limit up to 50MB, while the Nitro goes a step further and allows 100MB</li><li>Users of both paid versions will get a badge which will be displayed with their usernames</li><li>You can upgrade your image to an animated GIF!</li><li>With paid subscriptions, you can create customized usernames and emojis to enhance your experience</li></ul><p>One significant difference between the Nitro and Nitro Classic versions is the difference between their server boost capability.</p><p>Server boost is a user-gifted advantage that paid subscribers can provide to server owners to unlock extra perks for other users. The Nitro service has two server boosts, unlike the Nitro Classic service.</p><h2 id="Part-4-How-to-Subscribe-to-Discord-Nitro"><a href="#Part-4-How-to-Subscribe-to-Discord-Nitro" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: How to Subscribe to Discord Nitro?"></a>Part 4: How to Subscribe to Discord Nitro?</h2><p>Looking at the perks you get if you become a paid Discord member, it’s evident that several users will want to avail the opportunity.

Though, to rival other apps like Instagram and TikTok, Snapchat has recently added a “Sound” feature. With this newly-added option, users can add music to a Snapchat video pretty easily and make their snaps more interesting. In this post, I’m going to let you know how to add music to a Snapchat video without any hassle. Let’s get it started and level-up your Snapchat game!</p><h2 id="Part-1-What’s-the-Sound-Feature-in-Snapchat"><a href="#Part-1-What’s-the-Sound-Feature-in-Snapchat" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What’s the Sound Feature in Snapchat?"></a>Part 1: What’s the Sound Feature in Snapchat?</h2><p>Before we learn how to add music to your Snapchat video, let’s quickly get to know about the “Sounds” feature of the app. If you have been using Instagram or TikTok, then you might be familiar with their music feature.</p><p>Similarly, in 2020, Snapchat has also included a Sound feature that lets us add music to our snaps (photos or videos). For this, you can integrate Snapchat with a streaming service like Spotify, Pandora, Apple Music, or Soundcloud. While it doesn’t include all sorts of tracks, you can find most of the popular songs so that you can easily add music to a Snapchat video and make it interesting.</p><p>Once the other person would view your snap, they can hear the music playing in the background. If they want to listen to it or know more about the song, then they can just tap on its sticker on your snap.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-Music-to-a-Snapchat-Video-on-iPhone-or-Android"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-Music-to-a-Snapchat-Video-on-iPhone-or-Android" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add Music to a Snapchat Video on iPhone or Android?"></a>Part 2: How to Add Music to a Snapchat Video on iPhone or Android?</h2><p>One of the best things about Snapchat is that the overall interface of the app is pretty similar for both iOS and Android versions. Therefore, to learn how to add music on a Snapchat video, you need to follow the same process. As of now, you can find almost all the popular songs on Snapchat and can even record your own sounds.</p><p>To learn how to add music to your Snapchat video on your Android or iOS device, you can just follow this simple drill.</p><p><strong>Step 1: Visit the Snapchat Sound section on the app</strong></p><p>At first, just launch the Snapchat application on your device and tap on the camera icon from the home to start recording.</p><p>Using the rear or front camera of your device, you can now record any video on Snapchat. Once the video is recorded, you can tap on the music icon from the sidebar to add a song to a Snapchat video.</p><p><strong>Step 2: Search for any music to include in your Snaps</strong></p><p>As you would tap on the <strong>Music</strong> icon, you can view a list of various songs supported by Snapchat. If you want to look for anything specific, then just tap on the search icon and enter keywords to find a song of your choice.</p><p>Afterward, Snapchat will list the searched results, and you can tap on the play icon to first listen to the song. Just tap on the icon of the song and click on the “Next” button from the bottom to include it in the snap.</p><p><strong>Step 3: Trim and add the song to your Snapchat video</strong></p><p>Now, Snapchat will automatically display the snippet of the music at the bottom. You can use the left or the right slider option to trim the section of the music you want to add. Here, you also can tap on the play icon to listen to the track first.</p><p><strong>Step 4: Add music to your Snapchat video after recording</strong></p><p>That’s it! Once you have trimmed the music snippet, you can post it. You can tap on the shutter or the download icon first to save the video on your phone.</p><p>Now, you can preview the music via its sticker. You can just tap on the music sticker to change its appearance or drag it on the screen to place it anywhere you like. To change its size, you can just pinch-in or pinch-out the sticker.</p><p>In the end, just tap on the send icon to post your snap. You can add it to your story or sent it to any Snapchat contact. When they would open it, they can listen to the added song and even tap on the sticker to load it.</p><p>In this way, anyone can learn how to put music on a Snapchat video without any hassle.</p><h2 id="Part-3-FAQs-on-Adding-Music-to-a-Snapchat-Video"><a href="#Part-3-FAQs-on-Adding-Music-to-a-Snapchat-Video" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: FAQs on Adding Music to a Snapchat Video"></a>Part 3: FAQs on Adding Music to a Snapchat Video</h2><p>Now when you know how to add music to your Snapchat video, let’s clear some common doubts related to it.</p><ul><li><strong>How to add your own music to a Snapchat video?</strong></li></ul><p>Apart from the available songs on Snapchat, the app also lets us add the sound of our choice. For this, just click on the music icon and tap the “Create Sound” button instead. This will let you record anything or create your own music on Snapchat.</p><ul><li><strong>Why are some songs not available on Snapchat?</strong></li></ul><p>The Sound feature of Snapchat only provides licensed music by collaborating with some of the biggest record labels. Therefore, while you can find most of the popular songs, chances are that some of them might be missing from the collection.</p><ul><li><strong>Why can’t I add music to my Snapchat videos?</strong></li></ul><p>Well, there could be two possible reasons for this – you might be using an old version of Snapchat or the feature might not be available in your region yet. To fix this, you can just go to the Snapchat page on the App&#x2F;Play Store and tap on the “Update” button.

In this section, you can learn <strong>how to send snaps from the camera roll</strong> without capturing a live snap. For this, we will explain some manual methods as well as some reliable apps in a detailed manner.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Using-a-Snapchat-Filter"><a href="#Method-1-Using-a-Snapchat-Filter" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Using a Snapchat Filter"></a>Method 1: Using a Snapchat Filter</h3><p>Snapchat allows you to apply its filters on any of your camera roll’s pictures. By selecting a particular photo or video from your memories or snap, you can instantly add a filter to them. Afterward, you can send the filtered image to your friends as a regular snap. However, this solution has a significant drawback that you must know. The limitation is that the receiver of the snap would be able to see that the sent picture is from the camera roll.</p><p>Step1 Open your Snapchat and swipe up to open the ‘Memories’. Go to your Camera Roll and select any particular picture from there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-1.jpg"                      alt="access camera roll tab"                ></p><p>Step2 After choosing a particular photo, tap on the “<strong>Edit</strong>“ icon at the bottom left corner. You can apply filters to the photo by swiping from right to left. Keep swiping until you can find your preferred filter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-2.jpg"                      alt="tap on edit option"                ></p><p>Step1 Once you have applied the filter to the photo, touch on the “Send To” button. Choose any Snapchat friend to whom you want to send the picture. Next, hit the “Send” icon again to send the photo successfully.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-3.jpg"                      alt="tap on send to button"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Using-a-Sticker"><a href="#Method-2-Using-a-Sticker" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using a Sticker"></a>Method 2: Using a Sticker</h3><p>If you want to make your camera roll picture funny and entertaining, you can add stickers to it. Through Snapchat, you can make your customized sticker of any interesting face or object. Moreover, Snapchat also offers a huge variety of built-in stickers. If you don’t want to create a customized sticker, you can easily add the built-in sticker with a single tap.</p><p>Step1 Once you have opened your Snapchat, go to Memories. From there, you can access and select any picture from the Camera Roll.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-4.jpg"                      alt="choose camera roll option"                ></p><p>Step2 After selecting a specific picture from Camera Roll, tap on the “Pencil” icon at the bottom left corner to edit the photo. Afterward, select the “Scissor” icon from the right section. Using the Snapchat Scissor, you can create a sticker of any face or object you find interesting. Just select any area of the photo using your finger.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-5.jpg"                      alt="create your sticker"                ></p><p>Step3 Now close the picture opened for creating the sticker. Once done, take a snap from your Snapchat to proceed. Now from the right section, tap on the “Sticker” icon. Here, you can choose the built-in stickers easily. Or you can navigate to the “Scissor” icon to select your created sticker.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-6.jpg"                      alt="access the created stickers"                ></p><p>Step4 Once done with adding and adjusting the sticker, hit the “Send To” button. Choose your preferred contact and tap on the “Send” icon again.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-7.jpg"                      alt="hit the send to button"                ></p><h3 id="Method-3-Using-the-LMK-App"><a href="#Method-3-Using-the-LMK-App" class="headerlink" title="Method 3: Using the LMK App"></a>Method 3: Using the LMK App</h3><p>Another efficient way to send a camera roll picture as a regular snap is by using a third-party app. LMK is a reliable social media platform that enables you to communicate with friends having similar interests. You can craft your profile by adding your interests and hobbies.</p><p>It helps people to create a safe and healthy community for enhanced communication. In this solution, we will guide you on <strong>how to send</strong> <strong>snaps from the camera roll</strong> using the LMK app. Through this app, you can send snaps to your friends without mentioning the camera roll.</p><p>Step1 Open your Snapchat either from your Android or iOS device. Proceed to the Memories section and select Camera Roll. Here, tap on any picture that you want to send.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-8.jpg"                      alt="choose picture from camera roll"                ></p><p>Step2 Now hit the “Arrow” button to share the selected snap. From the displayed options, tap on the “Download” icon to save the picture on your device gallery.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-9.jpg"                      alt="download the selected photo"                ></p><p>Step3 Now head to your Play Store or App Store according to the OS of your mobile device. From there, download the LMK app. After its complete installation, open this app using your Snapchat login.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-10.jpg"                      alt="download and install lmk app"                ></p><p>Step4 On the LMK app, tap on the “Plus” icon to proceed. Afterward, tap on “Post” and hit the “Camera” icon from the bottom left side. Now choose the photo that you have recently saved in your gallery.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-11.jpg"                      alt="tap on camera icon"                ></p><p>Step5 After choosing the photo from the gallery, tap “Post to Snapchat.” By doing so, you will be redirected to your Snapchat. From your image, remove the added stickers of the LMK app. You can drag the sticker to the trash bin icon. Afterward, tap on the “Paper Clip” icon to remove the added attachment.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-12.jpg"                      alt="remove the sticker and link"                ></p><p>Step6 Once done with removing the sticker and attached link, hit the “Send” button. Now choose a Snapchat contact and hit the “Send” button.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-13.jpg"                      alt="send snap using lmk app"                ></p><h3 id="Method-4-Casper-APK-for-Android"><a href="#Method-4-Casper-APK-for-Android" class="headerlink" title="Method 4: Casper APK for Android"></a>Method 4: Casper APK for Android</h3><p>Casper is an excellent alternative for Snapchat users. Using this app, you can instantly add stickers and filters to the captured snaps. You can also save and forward snaps using this app to other platforms. However, Casper is not available on the Play Store.

In this section, you can learn <strong>how to send snaps from the camera roll</strong> without capturing a live snap. For this, we will explain some manual methods as well as some reliable apps in a detailed manner.</p><h3 id="Method-1-Using-a-Snapchat-Filter-1"><a href="#Method-1-Using-a-Snapchat-Filter-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 1: Using a Snapchat Filter"></a>Method 1: Using a Snapchat Filter</h3><p>Snapchat allows you to apply its filters on any of your camera roll’s pictures. By selecting a particular photo or video from your memories or snap, you can instantly add a filter to them. Afterward, you can send the filtered image to your friends as a regular snap. However, this solution has a significant drawback that you must know. The limitation is that the receiver of the snap would be able to see that the sent picture is from the camera roll.</p><p>Step1 Open your Snapchat and swipe up to open the ‘Memories’. Go to your Camera Roll and select any particular picture from there.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-1.jpg"                      alt="access camera roll tab"                ></p><p>Step2 After choosing a particular photo, tap on the “<strong>Edit</strong>“ icon at the bottom left corner. You can apply filters to the photo by swiping from right to left. Keep swiping until you can find your preferred filter.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-2.jpg"                      alt="tap on edit option"                ></p><p>Step1 Once you have applied the filter to the photo, touch on the “Send To” button. Choose any Snapchat friend to whom you want to send the picture. Next, hit the “Send” icon again to send the photo successfully.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-3.jpg"                      alt="tap on send to button"                ></p><h3 id="Method-2-Using-a-Sticker-1"><a href="#Method-2-Using-a-Sticker-1" class="headerlink" title="Method 2: Using a Sticker"></a>Method 2: Using a Sticker</h3><p>If you want to make your camera roll picture funny and entertaining, you can add stickers to it. Through Snapchat, you can make your customized sticker of any interesting face or object. Moreover, Snapchat also offers a huge variety of built-in stickers. If you don’t want to create a customized sticker, you can easily add the built-in sticker with a single tap.</p><p>Step1 Once you have opened your Snapchat, go to Memories. From there, you can access and select any picture from the Camera Roll.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2022/11/send-snaps-from-camera-roll-4.jpg"                      alt="choose camera roll option"                ></p><p>Step2 After selecting a specific picture from Camera Roll, tap on the “Pencil” icon at the bottom left corner to edit the photo.

There is no two way about the fact that this app is the new kid in town. It is highly popular among the younger generation.</p><p>If you are a new TikToker, you need an introduction video. This has to be engaging enough to attract more and more followers. The primary aim of an introduction video is to say high to your followers and tell them about yourself. With this video, they will get to know you better.</p><p>You May Also Like: <a class="link"   href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >How to Upload a Video to TikTok from Mac or PC&gt;&gt;&gt; <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p><h2 id="Section-1-Make-an-Intro-Video-on-TikTok-iPhone"><a href="#Section-1-Make-an-Intro-Video-on-TikTok-iPhone" class="headerlink" title="Section 1. Make an Intro Video on TikTok (iPhone)"></a>Section 1. Make an Intro Video on TikTok (iPhone)</h2><p>In case you are all set to create a Tiktok intro video, here are a few tips you need to follow.</p><p>• Including Audio</p><p>At the top of the screen, you will find the option ‘Sound’. This is where you can look through the music. When you are done choosing the song, decide where you would like it to start and play it when you record to sync the shots better. You can also add sound effects and voice-over.</p><p>At present, you can add one song per video inside the app. However, you always have the option to edit the videos using other apps to upload on TikTok.</p><p>In TikTok, you can work with multiple audio layers. For example, you have recorded the clip with in-camera audio, sound effect, music, and anything else you have added. The app will let you lower the camera’s audio volume while raising the music volume.</p><p>• Working with the Text</p><p>For adding title or text to the video, you have to use the Text button. This lets you choose the color, font, and size of the words. If you have used Instagram fonts, this will appear similar. Once you enter the words, choose where you would like to apply them on the screen. You can also set the time and length of the text appearing on the screen.</p><p>• Adding Effects</p><p>Effects are one of the special aspects of TikTok. There are two ways to use them, before or after recording. When you’re done recording the video, you can reverse it, speed it up, or add filters. The app also lets you apply an effect when you are recording.</p><p>Since TikTok videos are mostly viewed on smartphones, vertical orientation is the best option. However, horizontal orientation is also allowed on TikTok. <strong>The best aspect ratio will be 9:16 for TikTok videos</strong> so that they can be viewed properly on any smartphone. Last, but not least, <strong>the dimension has to be 1080 x 1920.</strong></p><h2 id="Section-2-Make-a-TikTok-Intro-Video-on-Mac"><a href="#Section-2-Make-a-TikTok-Intro-Video-on-Mac" class="headerlink" title="Section 2.

Anyone can go viral and become TikTok famous by gaining more likes, lots of views, and video shares. TikTok’s algorithm can put your videos at the top of the “For You” scroll and turn you into a sensation overnight, thus skyrocketing your followers count in a matter of few days. But, did you know that TikTok removed almost 50 million videos in just 6 months because those videos violated its rules?</p><p>While this social media site can easily be your shot to fame, it can even take away your audience. Or worse, it can ban you from using the app if you do not follow its community guidelines and rules. And, if you’ve been on TikTok for a while now, chances are you’ve heard about users getting ‘shadowbanned’. It’s not unusual for users to unknowingly stop receiving likes, views, and traffic on their accounts due to <strong>TikTok shadowban</strong>.</p><p>Ever since the influx of social media, shadow banning, also known as ghost banning or stealth banning, has been around. It comes up when content has been blocked or partially blocked. Sadly, when your TikTok account is shadowbanned, it will negatively affect your reach and halt your growth. Influencers and businesses rely on social media to create a community. And when they lose a part of that community, they feel a loss of support.</p><p>Wondering what shadowbanning entails, how to determine if you’ve been shadowbanned, and <strong>how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok</strong>? Check out below.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://neveragain.allstatics.com/2019/assets/icon/logo/filmora-horizontal.svg"                      alt="filmora logo"                ></p><h2 id="A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators"><a href="#A-cross-platform-for-making-videos-anywhere-for-all-creators" class="headerlink" title="A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators"></a>A cross-platform for making videos anywhere for all creators</h2><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/filmora12/side_brand_filmora12.png"                      alt="filmora-02"                ></p><p> Why your video editing isn’t good enough?

Basically, it means your account has been banned. But, the shadow part of the term means that you won’t know about the ban.</p><p>Shadowban on TikTok is a restriction that prevents your videos from appearing on the <strong>For You</strong> page or on hashtag results. It is a situation where your visibility has been reduced or where you have been banned from the platform, without your knowledge.</p><p>The act of shadowbanning a TikTok account is an automatic process done by TikTok’s algorithm to protect other users against spam content, copyright issues, and adult content. When you get shadowbanned, you stop receiving likes, views, and traffic from the For You page. Often, shadowbans go unnoticed until another user who stumbled upon your video points it out.</p><h2 id="Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban"><a href="#Part-2-How-Long-is-TikTok-Shadowban" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?"></a>Part 2: How Long is TikTok Shadowban?</h2><p>At the early stages of TikTok, shadowbans lasted for 24 hours. But, with the latest update in the TikTok algorithm, the length of TikTok shadowban is growing. Nowadays, a TikTok account is shadowbanned for approximately up to 2 weeks.</p><p>Within the first week, there will be a drop in your followers and so will the views. After a few days of the account shadowban being in place, you won’t be able to enter any tags or make new videos on TikTok unless they are public.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-shadowban.png"                      alt="tiktok shadowban"                ></p><h2 id="Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned"><a href="#Part-3-How-Do-I-Know-If-I-am-Shadowbanned" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?"></a>Part 3: How Do I Know If I am Shadowbanned?</h2><p>The TikTok app doesn’t ever actually tell if you are shadowbanned. But, if you are then you can probably notice it. If you are shadowbanned, your videos will neither show up on the TikTok “For You” page nor will they appear when you search them via hashtag.</p><p>During a TikTok shadowban, your videos and content will not:</p><ul><li>be visible in the search results</li><li>be visible on the feed</li><li>receive new followers</li><li>receive likes from others</li><li>receive comments from others</li></ul><h2 id="Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok"><a href="#Part-4-Why-am-I-Getting-Shadowbanned-On-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?"></a>Part 4: Why am I Getting Shadowbanned On TikTok?</h2><p>TikTok has not issued any explanation on its shadowbanning techniques. However, what makes complete sense is that TikTok shadowbans its users for creating videos that violate its community guidelines.</p><p>Any video with offensive content that can harm the sentiments of people or anything that can trigger other users can attract TikTok shadowban. The app might limit the visibility of your content for reasons such as your account acting as spam or you are posting inappropriate content.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/shadowbanned-on-tiktok.png"                      alt="shadowbanned on tiktok"                ></p><p><strong>Spam Behavior</strong></p><p>The primary reason why a user’s TikTok account can get shadowbanned is that they behave like a spammer. Usually, new people go on a spree of liking and following people in the hope that they will like and follow back. However, TikTok might recognize this behavior as spam and consider you as a robot.</p><p>If you like more than 100 posts daily, you might want to slow down. If you follow more than 50 TikTok accounts in a day, it is best to re-evaluate that strategy.</p><p><strong>Inappropriate Content</strong></p><p>Posting videos that go against the TikTok rules and community guidelines can get you shadowbanned or permanently banned.</p><p>The following content is considered inappropriate by TikTok:</p><ul><li>hate speech</li><li>fake news</li><li>violence</li><li>nudity</li><li>drugs</li><li>copyrighted music</li></ul><p>TikTok is committed to make its platform an inclusive and safe space. So, if you have experienced a drop in views or engagement, consider reassessing your recent content.</p><h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Fix-TikTok-Shadowban-and-Get-Unshadowbanned"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Fix-TikTok-Shadowban-and-Get-Unshadowbanned" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?"></a>Part 5: How to Fix TikTok Shadowban and Get Unshadowbanned?</h2><p>Wondering about how do you get unshadowbanned on TikTok? Here’s what you can do to remove your shadowban:</p><h4 id="Uninstall-and-Reinstall-TikTok"><a href="#Uninstall-and-Reinstall-TikTok" class="headerlink" title="Uninstall and Reinstall TikTok"></a>Uninstall and Reinstall TikTok</h4><p>Firstly, delete your recent video. If it doesn’t work, uninstall and then reinstall the TikTok app. Sometimes, your app might just need an update to become functional once again.</p><h4 id="Switch-to-A-Pro-Account"><a href="#Switch-to-A-Pro-Account" class="headerlink" title="Switch to A Pro Account"></a>Switch to A Pro Account</h4><p>When doing a Google search on how to get unshadowbanned on TikTok, the most common tip you’ll find is to go into the Settings of your TikTok account and tap “Switch to a Pro Account”. The reason is that making the switch will allow you to see analytics for your posts and find out how people access your videos. By doing this, you can easily monitor how far your engagement has increased or dropped.</p><p><img                       lazyload                     src="/images/loading.svg"                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/tiktok-pro-account.jpg"                      alt="tiktok pro account"                ></p><h4 id="Delete-Offensive-Content"><a href="#Delete-Offensive-Content" class="headerlink" title="Delete Offensive Content"></a>Delete Offensive Content</h4><p>You should delete content that goes against the rules and community guidelines laid down by TikTok. After deleting inappropriate content, you have to wait for at least two weeks to get the shadowban lifted. You can refresh your device once in a while to check if you have finally managed to lift the ban.</p><h4 id="Put-TikTok-On-Hold-for-Sometime"><a href="#Put-TikTok-On-Hold-for-Sometime" class="headerlink" title="Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime"></a>Put TikTok On Hold for Sometime</h4><p>Once you have deleted offensive content, clear the cache, close your app, ensure it is updated and then take a break from TikTok for a few days. Coming back after you have cleaned up your account and taken the needed break might get you unshadowbanned on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Post-Original-Innovative-Content"><a href="#Post-Original-Innovative-Content" class="headerlink" title="Post Original, Innovative Content"></a>Post Original, Innovative Content</h4><p>When you return to posting content, you need to make sure your TikTok account doesn’t get shadowbanned again. Your account has already been flagged for something and so you need to try even harder to behave. If you go back to posting the same kind of content that got you banned in the first place, you will be booted off the stage again.</p><p>Ensure you always post original content with innovative ideas. Brainstorm new ideas with your team and come up with something new and unique. This way, you can avoid copyright infringement laws on TikTok.</p><h4 id="Know-Your-Audience-More"><a href="#Know-Your-Audience-More" class="headerlink" title="Know Your Audience More"></a>Know Your Audience More</h4><p>These days, there are many kids and minor accounts on TikTok, and maintaining a healthy environment is a part of your responsibility. Keep your videos free from sexualized themes, nudity, pornographic material, and suggestive themes. Remember; posting such content can land you in serious trouble with TikTok shadowban.</p><h2 id="Part-6-Use-Excellent-Video-Editors-to-Make-Amazing-TikTok-Videos"><a href="#Part-6-Use-Excellent-Video-Editors-to-Make-Amazing-TikTok-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Part 6: Use Excellent Video Editors to Make Amazing TikTok Videos"></a>Part 6: Use Excellent Video Editors to Make Amazing TikTok Videos</h2><p>With increasing competition among TikTok users, it is important to use a powerful video editing tool to make your TikTok videos stand out.
